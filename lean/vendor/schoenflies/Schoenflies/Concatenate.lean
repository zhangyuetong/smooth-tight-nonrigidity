# Gluing arcs

Two arcs meeting only at the endpoint they share glue to one arc; two arcs meeting at *both*
of their ends glue to a Jordan curve. The glued parametrisation runs the first arc over the
lower half of the parameter interval and the second over the upper half, each at double
speed: `t ↦ f (2 * t)` below the midpoint and `t ↦ g (2 * t - 1)` above it. Since the
parameter here is an honest real number, that is literally what the definition says.

The halves are `[0, 1/2]` and `[1/2, 1]`. They cover the interval, and each is closed, so
continuity is Mathlib's pasting lemma `ContinuousOn.union_of_isClosed`. Injectivity splits
four ways — both parameters below the midpoint, both above, and the two mixed orders — and
only the mixed cases use the hypothesis that the two arcs meet nowhere else: there the common
value lies on both arcs, hence is the shared endpoint, and each arc's own injectivity pins
its parameter to the midpoint.

At the midpoint itself both branches of the `if` are meaningful and they agree, precisely
because the first arc finishes where the second starts. That is what makes the glued map well
defined rather than merely continuous, and it is why `concatenate_upperHalf` — the statement
that the glued map *is* the retimed second arc on the whole closed upper half, midpoint
included — carries the shared-endpoint hypothesis.

For the loop the seam analysis gains a second legitimate meeting point: besides the middle,
where the arcs are glued, there are the outer ends, where the loop is allowed to repeat
itself. Pinning those needs the start/finish counterparts of the midpoint lemmas.

## Blueprint

* `concatenate` — §1, the glued parametrisation.
* `IsArc.concatenate`, `IsArcBetween.concatenate` — two arcs meeting only at the endpoint they
  share glue to an arc.
* `IsLoop.concatenate` — two arcs glued along both of their ends make a loop.
* `IsJordanCurve.of_two_arcs` — two arcs meeting exactly at their two shared endpoints make a
  Jordan curve; the converse of the two-arcs decomposition, and the form every *construction*
  of a curve takes.

/-! ### Pinning a parameter at the seam

At a point where two of the pieces meet, the value is one of the shared points, and the
injectivity of the arc it belongs to pins the parameter. Each half needs its own statement,
since they retime differently; the loop needs the outer ends as well as the middle. -/

/-! ### Closing the loop

Two arcs that share *both* of their ends — the second runs back from where the first arrived
to where it set out — glue to a loop rather than to an arc. Everything above carries over
except the seam analysis: a common value now has two ways to be legitimate, at the middle
where the arcs are glued and at the outer ends where the loop closes, and the second of those
is exactly the repetition `IsLoop` allows itself at the finish. -/

/-- Across the seam, when the two arcs also share their outer ends. At the middle the
argument is the one for arcs; at the outer ends the second arc is at its finish, so its
parameter is `1` — which the hypothesis has excluded. -/
