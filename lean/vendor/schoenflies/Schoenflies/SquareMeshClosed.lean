# The anchored square mesh, closed

`Schoenflies/SquareMesh.lean` builds `Schoenflies.squareMesh δ fresh anchors` and proves the
geometric clauses of `prop:anchored-square-mesh`; `Schoenflies/SquareMeshConnected.lean`,
`Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` and `Schoenflies/LocalGrid.lean` add the grid combinatorics,
the outer cycle from an explicit path-subdivision hypothesis, and the degenerate cases. This
module proves that path-subdivision hypothesis for the mesh.

## The hypothesis that is discharged here

`Schoenflies.SubdividesToPath pieces points` says: *the overlay edges lying inside a source
segment are exactly the edges of a path of the overlay from one end of that segment to the
other.* `SquareMeshFixed.lean` states it as an explicit hypothesis, and its docstring says the
theorem does not exist on `main`.

It does exist. `Schoenflies.exists_incWalk_insideEdges` in `Schoenflies/SquareCycle.lean` is
exactly that statement in the vocabulary of `Graph.IsIncWalk` — a walk along which
`dist P.1 ·` strictly increases — and `Graph.IsIncWalk.isPath` turns it into a path. The two
modules were simply never in one import chain: `SquareCycle.lean` was imported only by
`Schoenflies/JordanClosed.lean`. `Schoenflies.subdividesToPath_of_overlay` is the four-line
bridge, allowing the results of `SquareMeshFixed.lean` to be applied directly to the mesh.

## The outer cycle, as data

`Schoenflies.meshGraph_outer_cycle` is existential — its own docstring says *"once that
hypothesis is discharged by a theorem exporting the chain as a `def`, this should be restated
with the cycle as data"*. That is done here: `outerCycleEdge`, `outerCycleStart`,
`outerCycleEnd`, `outerCycleThird` and `outerCycleDetour` are `def`s, and the three clauses
are separate lemmas about them. A consumer needing the outer cycle of the mesh takes these
five names, not an `∃` it has to destructure at every use.

## Clause 5, and the hypothesis that is actually true

Clause 5 — *the skeleton of `T` is 2-connected* — was absent from every earlier module, and for
a good reason: it is **false** for `Schoenflies.squareMesh δ fresh anchors` when `fresh` has
fewer than two distinct points (`Schoenflies.not_isTwoConnected_meshGraph_of_fresh_subsingleton`),
and `Schoenflies.FreshDense fresh δ` alone does not repair it
(`Schoenflies.freshDense_not_isTwoConnected`). What repairs it is `FreshDense fresh δ` together
with `δ < 4`, which forces two distinct fresh points
(`Schoenflies.exists_two_distinct_fresh_of_freshDense`). The blueprint's caller uses
`δ = ε_n = 2⁻ⁿ`, far below `4`, so the hypothesis is free at the only call site.

The assembly is the blueprint's, with one correction. The blueprint says *"adding these finitely
many cycles one at a time"*, but the **first** addition cannot be a cycle: distinct rings of the
mesh are disjoint, so no two of them share the two vertices `lem:union-two-connected` needs. The
first addition is an **ear** — down the spoke at `z`, round the inner ring, back up the spoke at
`w` — and that is precisely where the two distinct fresh points are spent. After it, every
further ring shares the crossing points `r • z ≠ r • w` with the spokes and goes in by
`lem:union-two-connected`, and every further spoke is an ear between the outer and inner rings.
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.of_le_of_vertexSet_subset` then transfers 2-connectivity from the assembly
to the mesh, since every mesh vertex lies on a ring or on a spoke.

## The proposition, clause by clause

`prop:anchored-square-mesh` is exported as **data with its clauses as separate lemmas**: the
object is the `def` `Schoenflies.squareMesh δ fresh anchors`, and nothing is `∃`-packaged.

1. every 2-cell has diameter `< δ` — `Schoenflies.squareMesh_face_small`;
2. every anchor on `S` is a boundary vertex — `Schoenflies.squareMesh_anchor_mem_vertexSet`;
3. every new internal edge meeting `S` ends at a fresh point —
   `Schoenflies.squareMesh_inner_edge_at_fresh`;
4. exactly one such edge at each fresh point — `Schoenflies.squareMesh_unique_inner_edge`;
5. the skeleton is 2-connected — **`Schoenflies.squareMesh_isTwoConnected`** (this module);
6. `|T| ∖ S` is connected — `Schoenflies.squareMesh_isConnected_diff`.

and the outer cycle, which `def:admissible-graph` and every downstream consumer need as a
genuine cycle rather than a point set — `Schoenflies.squareMesh_isLongCycle_outerCycle`,
`Schoenflies.squareMesh_outerCycle_edgesCover` (this module).

## Blueprint

* `subdividesToPath_of_overlay`, `meshSubdividesToPath` — `lem:polygonal-overlay`: the
  subdivision of one source segment is a path of the overlay. This discharges
  `Schoenflies.SubdividesToPath`.
* `meshGraph_outer_cycle_of_mem_modelCurve`, `squareMesh_outer_cycle` —
  `prop:anchored-square-mesh` clause 3 as a **cycle**, with no hypothesis beyond `fresh ⊆ S`.
* `outerCycleEdge`, `outerCycleStart`, `outerCycleEnd`, `outerCycleThird`, `outerCycleDetour`,
  `squareMesh_isLongCycle_outerCycle`, `squareMesh_outerCycle_subset_modelCurve`,
  `squareMesh_outerCycle_edgesCover` — the same cycle as data with its clauses as lemmas.
* `rsideT`/`rsideL`/`rsideB`/`rsideR` and `meshGraph_ring_cycle` — the outer-cycle argument at
  every radius: each ring of the mesh is a long cycle occupying exactly that ring.
* `ringGraph`, `ringGraph_isTwoConnected`, `mem_vertexSet_ringGraph` — each ring as a named
  2-connected subgraph, via `Schoenflies.squareGraph` at centre `0`.
* `spokePiece_inter_ringSet`, `smul_mem_meshPoints`, `smul_mem_vertexSet_ringGraph` —
  the crossing points `r • z` as vertices, from the `MeetsAreCut` clause of `meshPoints`.
* `spokeWalk`, `spokeGraph` — each spoke as a path of the mesh.
* `meshEar`, `meshEar_isPath`, `meshCore_isTwoConnected` — `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b):
  the ear that joins the outer ring to the inner one.
* `attachRings`, `attachSpokes` and their 2-connectivity — `lem:union-two-connected` and
  `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` iterated, the blueprint's *"adding these finitely many cycles
  one at a time"*.
* `meshGraph_isTwoConnected`, `squareMesh_isTwoConnected` — `prop:anchored-square-mesh`
  clause 5.

`Schoenflies.insideEdges` are the same statement: `Q ∈ E(overlayGraph pieces points)` unfolds

walk into a path, which `Graph.IsIncWalk.isPath` does. -/

/-! ### The four sides of a ring of arbitrary radius

`Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` names the four sides of the *outer* ring — `sideT`, `sideL`,
`sideB`, `sideR` — and proves the handful of coordinate facts that the outer-cycle argument
runs on. Every inner ring needs the same facts, so they are restated here with the radius as a

/-! ### Every ring of the mesh is a cycle

`Schoenflies.meshGraph_outer_cycle` proves this for the outer ring, `r = 1`, and every step of
its proof is about the four sides of that ring and nothing else. With the sides of a ring of
arbitrary radius now available, the same argument runs verbatim at every radius: the four sides
are four overlay paths, three concatenations glue them into one path once round the ring, and
the last edge of the fourth is peeled off to close the cycle.

This is the theorem the blueprint's *"adding these finitely many cycles one at a time"* needs
for the inner rings, and which `Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` names as missing. -/

/-- **Every ring of the mesh is a long cycle of the mesh graph**, and its edges occupy exactly
that ring.

For `r = 1` this is `Schoenflies.meshGraph_outer_cycle`; the content added here is that the
statement holds at every radius of `Schoenflies.meshRadii`, which is what the assembly of
clause 5 of `prop:anchored-square-mesh` consumes. -/

/-! ### Each ring of the mesh, as a named 2-connected subgraph

`Schoenflies/SquareCycle.lean` proves that the part of *any* polygonal overlay lying on the
boundary of a square whose four sides are among the overlay's source segments is a long cycle,
and is 2-connected — at any centre and any positive radius. The rings of the mesh are exactly
that, at centre `0`: `squarePieces 0 r` and `ringPieces r` are the same list. So each ring comes
with a name, `ringGraph`, a 2-connectivity proof, and the two membership lemmas the assembly of
clause 5 needs, at no cost. -/

/-! ### Where a spoke crosses a ring

`Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` records the crossing points `r • z` as the thing its
assembly of clause 5 lacked: *"the crossing points `r • z` as vertices (which needs the
`MeetsAreCut` clause of `meshPoints`)"*. That is what this section supplies. The sup norm is a
faithful coordinate along a spoke (`Schoenflies.supNorm_smul_of_mem_modelCurve`), so a spoke
meets the ring of radius `r` in the single point `r • z`; a singleton meet forces both ends of
the `MeetsAreCut` segment to be that point; and `mem_vertexSet_ringGraph` then makes it a
vertex of the ring. -/

/-! ### The spokes, as paths of the mesh

`Schoenflies.SubdividesToPath` — now a theorem — turns each spoke into a path of the mesh from
its outer end `z` to its inner end `N⁻¹ • z`. The path is exported as data, `spokeWalk`, so
that the assembly can name it; and the crossing points are shown to be among the vertices it
visits, which is what makes each ring attachable at two of them. -/

/-- **A cut point lying on a source segment is a vertex of the path that subdivides it.** The
edges of the path cover the segment, and a cut point is interior to no edge of an overlay, so
it is an *end* of one of them. -/

/-! ### The core: outer ring, two spokes, inner ring

The blueprint assembles clause 5 by *"adding these finitely many cycles one at a time"*, but
the first addition cannot be a cycle: distinct rings of the mesh are disjoint, so no two of
them share the two vertices `lem:union-two-connected` asks for. What joins them is an **ear** —
a path with both ends on the outer ring — and the only such path runs down one spoke, round
part of the inner ring, and back up another spoke. That is why clause 5 needs **two distinct
fresh points**, and why it is false with fewer
(`Schoenflies.not_isTwoConnected_meshGraph_of_fresh_subsingleton`).

Once that ear is in place the inner ring shares the two crossing points `N⁻¹ • z` and
`N⁻¹ • w` with it, and `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union` applies; from then on every further ring
shares `r • z` and `r • w`, and every further spoke is an ear between the outer and inner
rings. -/

/-- **Distinct spokes are disjoint** — the blueprint's *"two radial segments in the annulus can
meet only if they lie on the same ray, and then their endpoints on `S` are equal"*. -/

/-! ### The assembly

`meshCore` is the outer ring, the ear, and the inner ring. `attachRings` then adds every ring
by `lem:union-two-connected` at the two crossing points `r • z ≠ r • w`, and `attachSpokes`
adds every remaining spoke by `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b) — its two ends are `u` on the
outer ring and `N⁻¹ • u` on the inner one, both already present. Finally every vertex of the
mesh lies on a ring or on a spoke, so the assembled graph spans the mesh and
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.of_le_of_vertexSet_subset` transfers 2-connectivity to the mesh itself. -/

/-- **The assembly spans the mesh.** Every vertex of the mesh is an end of an edge, every edge
lies inside a mesh segment, and a mesh segment is either a ring side — putting the vertex on
that ring — or a spoke, putting it on that spoke's path. -/

The hypothesis is *two distinct fresh points*, and it is exactly right:
`Schoenflies.not_isTwoConnected_meshGraph_of_fresh_subsingleton` shows the conclusion is
**false** with fewer. -/

`Schoenflies.FreshDense fresh δ` alone does **not** suffice — `freshDense_not_isTwoConnected`
is the counterexample — but `FreshDense` together with `δ < 4` does, because it forces two
distinct fresh points (`Schoenflies.exists_two_distinct_fresh_of_freshDense`). The blueprint's
caller uses `δ = ε_n = 2⁻ⁿ`, far below `4`. -/
