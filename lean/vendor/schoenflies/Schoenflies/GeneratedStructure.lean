# Generated matched cell structures

The spine of Part II. `def:generated-structure` says that every cell structure the Schönflies
construction ever meets is obtained from the initial two-face structure of
`prop:initial-pair` by a finite sequence of two elementary operations — *edge subdivision* and
*2-cell splitting by an ear* — performed simultaneously in the two realizations. This module
builds the two operations as `def`s on `Schoenflies.CellStructure`, closes them into the
inductive `Schoenflies.GeneratedStructure`, and proves the assertions of
`lem:cellulation-invariants` that are within reach.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData`, `Schoenflies.CellStructure.subdivideEdge` — the first
  elementary operation of `def:generated-structure` (tex, operation 1).
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData`, `Schoenflies.CellStructure.splitFace` — the second
  (tex, operation 2).
* `Schoenflies.GeneratedStructure` — `def:generated-structure`, as the inductive closure of a
  base structure under the two operations.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.parent`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.parent`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.sub_parent`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.sub_parent` — assertion (iv) of
  `lem:cellulation-invariants`, the parent map of one elementary refinement and the
  compatibility `σ ≼ τ → par σ ≼ par τ`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.CombInvariants`, its two preservation theorems
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.combInvariants` and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.combInvariants`, and
  `Schoenflies.GeneratedStructure.combInvariants`, which closes the induction — assertions
  (iii), (v), (vi), together with the abstract form of (viii) and the bookkeeping facts about
  `≼_abs` that the blueprint uses silently.
* `Schoenflies.GeneratedStructure.trans` — refinement sequences compose.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsCellDecomposition` — assertion (i) for one
  realization, and from it, with no further geometry:
  `.frontier_property` (assertion (ii)), `.sub_iff_subset_closure` and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.subset_closure_congr` (assertion (ix)), and `.face_eq`
  (assertion (viii)).
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.IsRefinement` and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.IsRefinement.isCellDecomposition` — the induction step
  of assertion (i) over the *first* constructor: a realization of the subdivided structure that
  refines a realization of the old one inherits (i).
* `Schoenflies.crosscut_cell_partition` — the geometric content of one 2-cell split, from
  `Schoenflies.general_crosscut`, in the shape assertion (i) consumes.

**Not here.** The induction step of (i) over the *second* constructor, and assertion (vii) in
either. `crosscut_cell_partition` is the geometric input the split step needs; what is missing
is the `SplitData` analogue of `IsRefinement` — a relation between a realization of
`S.splitFace d` and one of `S`, saying that the ear is drawn as a crosscut of the realized open
2-cell — and the identification of the abstract boundary walk of a 2-cell with the Jordan curve
of assertion (vii). Assertions (ii), (viii) and (ix) are stated here against `(i)` as a
hypothesis, so later constructors can use the resulting theorem directly.

Two general graph facts are proved here for want of a home: `Schoenflies.subdivGraph` (with
`Schoenflies.subdivGraph_mono` and `Schoenflies.subdivGraph_eq_self`) and
`Schoenflies.isLink_of_le_of_mem_edgeSet`. The second belongs in `Schoenflies/Graph/`; nothing
on `main` states it.

## Design

**The base case is a parameter.** `prop:initial-pair` is being built elsewhere, so
`GeneratedStructure S₀ S` is relative to an arbitrary base `S₀`, and every invariant theorem
reads "the invariants of `S₀` propagate to `S`". That is both cleaner and independent of the
initial pair's schedule: the consumer supplies `S₀` and the base case, and gets the invariant
at every stage.

**`rem:intermediate-disconnection` is honoured by omission.** Nothing in this module mentions
`Realization.nonboundary`, let alone its connectedness: an intermediate stage really can have
disconnected open nonboundary part, and every statement here is proved without that hypothesis.

**`≼_abs` stays a raw datum.** `CellStructure.sub` is not made a preorder. The reflexivity and
transitivity facts that the blueprint uses are fields of `CombInvariants`, established for the
base and propagated, never assumed of an arbitrary `CellStructure`.

**Fidelity note on reflexivity.** The blueprint's two update lists (tex, operations 1 and 2)
do not mention the reflexive pairs of the *new* cells, while the base relation is declared to
contain "the reflexive pairs". Assertion (i) forces them: the closure of a new open cell
contains that cell, and (i) says a closed cell is the union of its open subcells. Both `subRel`
definitions below therefore declare `σ ≼ σ` for every new cell; that is the only place where
this module adds a pair the blueprint's prose does not list.

/-! ### Subdividing an edge of a graph

The graph-theoretic half of the first elementary operation, stated for an arbitrary graph so
that one definition serves both the skeleton and the outer cycle: when `H` does not carry `e`
from `x` to `y` — which is the case for the outer cycle whenever the subdivided edge is not an
outer edge — the construction leaves `H` alone (`subdivGraph_eq_self`). Without that, the
definition of `CellStructure.subdivideEdge` would need a case split on whether the subdivided
edge is outer, and every lemma about it would inherit the split. -/

/-- The graph `H` with the edge `e`, running from `x` to `y`, replaced by a new vertex `v` and
two new edges `e₁ : x — v`, `e₂ : v — y`.

The three guards `f ≠ e`, `f ≠ e₁`, `f ≠ e₂` on the surviving links make the three disjuncts
mutually exclusive with no hypotheses, and `hne` does the same for the last two. The freshness
hypotheses `h₁`, `h₂` are what make `edgeSet` right. -/

Blueprint, `def:generated-structure`, operation 1: "the edge `e` is replaced by a new vertex
`v` and two new edges `e₁, e₂`, whose endpoints are `v` together with one old endpoint of `e`
each; the relation `≼_abs` is extended by declaring `v ≼ e₁` and `v ≼ e₂`, each old endpoint of
`e` a subcell of its adjacent new edge, and `v, e₁, e₂` subcells of exactly the old strict
supercells of `e`; all pairs not involving `e` are unchanged." -/

/-- **The orientation-aware replacement of a subdivided edge in a walk.**
`SubstWalk S edge left right newEdge₁ newEdge₂ u W W'` says that `W'` is obtained from `W`
by replacing each traversal of `edge` by the two new edges in the order in which the walk
crosses them.  The departing vertex `u` supplies the orientation information that the edge
list alone does not contain. -/

direction in which a walk traverses an edge cannot be recovered from the edge list alone.

/-! ### Elementary operation 2: splitting a 2-cell by an ear

Blueprint, `def:generated-structure`, operation 2: "the 2-cell `R` is replaced by `R₁, R₂`; the
new interior vertices and edges of the ear `P` are added with their incidences along `P` (each
interior vertex a subcell of its two adjacent ear edges, each ear endpoint a subcell of its
adjacent ear edge); the relation `≼_abs` is extended by declaring every cell of the boundary
walk of `Rᵢ`, together with every cell of `P`, a subcell of `Rᵢ`, for `i = 1, 2`; no 2-cell is
declared a subcell of another, and all pairs not involving `R` or the new cells are unchanged."

The ear enters as a *graph* `ear` together with `Graph.IsPathGraph`, rather than as a bare list
of names: the incidences "along `P`" are then `ear.Inc`, and the union `S.skel.union ear` is
the new skeleton with no further bookkeeping. -/

/-- The data of one **2-cell split by an ear**: the split 2-cell, two fresh names for the two
new 2-cells, and the ear — a path graph whose two ends are old vertices and all of whose other
cells are fresh — together with the two boundary paths of the split cell between the ends of
the ear.

`sub_face` is the statement that the two boundary paths carry exactly the cells of the split
2-cell; `paths_meet` that they meet exactly at the two ends of the ear. Both are consequences of
the invariants at the stage being refined, and both are what the blueprint means by "the two
boundary paths between its endpoints".

**`paths_meet` used to read `paths_disjoint`** — that the two paths share no *edge* — and that
is too weak. Two edge-disjoint paths between the same two vertices may still share an interior
vertex: take parallel edges `e₁, f₁ : u — a` and `e₂, f₂ : a — v` and the paths `[e₁, e₂]`,
`[f₁, f₂]`. Every other field holds, and the two realized boundary paths then meet in three
points, so `IsCutPair.inter_eq` — which asks that the two arcs meet exactly at the two cut
points — is **false**, and with it the `isCutPair` field of `SplitData.IsCrosscutSplit`, hence
assertion (i) at the split constructor. The stronger clause is what a producer actually has,
since it picks the two paths as the two arcs of one boundary cycle; `paths_disjoint` below is
recovered from it. Found by the first module that ever built a realization of a split
(`Schoenflies/RealizeSplit.lean`), which had to carry it as a hypothesis. -/

its two endpoints being old cells). -/
