# Carriers, refinement compatibility, and the star lemmas

The interface between the *construction* of the nested cellulations and the *abstraction* the
limit homeomorphism uses. The blueprint says at the head of that section (tex, "The limit
homeomorphism of the interiors") that it "forgets how the decompositions were constructed and
uses only their nesting, matching, and shrinking properties"; everything below is therefore
stated for an abstract refinement relation `Realization.Refines` between two realizations of two
generated structures, and *not* for either elementary constructor. The two constructors enter
only at the very end, as the two theorems that produce a `Refines` from them.

## The carrier is a function

`Realization.carrier` is `car_Γ(x)` of the blueprint, exported as a total function `Plane → γ`
rather than as an existential: `σ_n(x)` is used on every line of the limit argument. Outside the
closed domain it is junk (whence the `[Nonempty γ]`), and every lemma about it carries the
hypothesis `x ∈ D` that makes it meaningful. Its characterising property is
`IsCellDecomposition.carrier_eq`: *any* cell whose open part contains `x` is the carrier.

## What `Refines` is, and why it is the right shape

`R'.Refines R par` says: `par` maps cells of the finer structure to cells of the coarser one and
2-cells to 2-cells, it is compatible with `≼_abs` (assertion (iv) of `lem:cellulation-invariants`),
and each *open* cell of the finer realization sits inside the open cell of its parent. The last
clause is the geometric content of the blueprint's proof of
`lem:refinement-compatibility`(a) — "a point in either new subedge or at the new vertex
had the old open edge as its old carrier" — and it implies the weaker
`closure (R'.cell σ) ⊆ closure (R.cell (par σ))` that part (b) needs.

`Refines` is a relation between two realizations of two *different* abstract structures over the
same name type `γ`, parametrised by the composite parent map. `Refines.trans` composes them, so
"a finite sequence of elementary refinements" needs no separate treatment: a consumer that builds
its stages one operation at a time gets the composite by iterating `trans`.

Part (c) of `lem:refinement-compatibility` — "corresponding cells have corresponding parents" —
is, under the representation of `CombinatorialInvariance.lean`, the statement that *one and the
same* `par : γ → γ` serves both realizations: cells are abstract names, and two `Refines`
instances sharing a `par` is exactly a compatible matched refinement. There is nothing to
transport, and the substance of (c) is its consequence, `Refines.carrier_congr`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.carrier` — `car_Γ(x)`, with
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsCellDecomposition.carrier_eq` its characterisation.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines` — a refinement of one generated matched cell
  structure by another, with `Refines.trans` for a finite sequence of them.
* `lem:refinement-compatibility`:
  * (a) `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.parent_carrier`;
  * (b) `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.star_subset` (cells) and
    `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.star_carrier_subset` (points);
  * (c) `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SkeletonHomeo.carrier_congr` (corresponding *skeleton points*
    have corresponding carriers, via
    `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SkeletonHomeo.image_cell`),
    `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.carrier_congr` (and then at every earlier
    stage), and the form the limit argument actually cites,
    `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.target_star_subset` (`T_{n+1}(x) ⊆ T_n(x)`).
* `lem:star-intersection` — `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.star_inter_nonempty_congr`.
* `lem:star-face-mesh` — `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsCellDecomposition.star_eq_faces`,
  with (a) `…diam_star_le`, `…diam_star_lt`, `…diam_star_carrier_lt` and (b)
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.diam_cell_le`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.Refines.diam_cell_le_of_forall`.
* `lem:cell-neighborhood` — `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.cellNbhd` and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsCellDecomposition.cell_neighborhood`.
* `rem:inductive-invariants` — honoured: nothing here is proved by a case check on the
  constructors. The inductive content lives in `GeneratedStructure.lean`; the two bridge theorems
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.IsRefinement.refines` and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.refines` are the only declarations that mention a
  constructor at all.

`Schoenflies.CellStructure.refines_of_elementary` is the shared bridge: both elementary
operations replace a single cell `c` by a set `N` of fresh cells and send `N` to `c`, so one
lemma serves both.

/-! ### Refinement

The abstract relation "`R'` refines `R` with parent map `par`". It is deliberately not tied to
either elementary operation: the limit argument uses only these three clauses. -/

/-- **`R'` refines `R` along the parent map `par`.**

`R'` and `R` realize two different abstract structures over the same name type; `par` is the
composite parent map of `lem:cellulation-invariants`(iv). The three combinatorial
clauses say that `par` takes cells to cells, 2-cells to 2-cells, and respects `≼_abs`; the
geometric clause says that each *open* cell of the finer stage lies inside the open cell of its
parent, which is what makes carriers refine (part (a)). -/

/-! ### Matched refinements: part (c)

Two realizations of one abstract structure are matched; a *compatible matched refinement* is a
pair of `Refines` instances sharing one parent map. That sharing **is** the blueprint's
"corresponding cells have corresponding parents": the parent map is a map of abstract names, so
there is only ever one of it. The substance is the consequence recorded here. -/

/-! ### The two elementary operations produce refinements

Both operations have the same shape: a single cell `c` is replaced by a set `N` of fresh cells,
and the parent map sends `N` to `c` and fixes everything else. `refines_of_elementary` proves the
geometric clause of `Refines` from that shape alone — the fresh cells must land inside `c`,
because any other cell of the old stage survives and is unmoved, and open cells of one stage are
disjoint. -/

inclusion gives `T_{n+1}(x) ⊆ T_n(x)` … their diameters tend to zero … by
`lem:nested-compact` their intersection is one point". This anonymous example is a machine-checked
statement that the four facts that sentence needs come out of this module for an *abstract*
nested sequence: nothing below mentions how the stages were built, and the mesh hypothesis is
read in the target realization while the carrier is read in the source one. -/
