# The sector decomposition at every point, and polygonal-side accessibility

Two things are done here. First, the last clause of Lemma "Local structure of a polygonal
skeleton" (`lem:local-skeleton-structure`) is closed: `Schoenflies/SkeletonSectors.lean` proves
it only at a point with **at least two** local branches, and the blueprint states it for every
point. Second, its consumer, Lemma "Polygonal-side accessibility"
(`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`), is proved.

## 1. The two degenerate points

`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_iUnion_cone` writes the punctured local disk as the
union of the sectors `Plane.cone x (Plane.arcCCW d w) r` between *consecutive* local directions
`d, w`. With fewer than two local directions there is no consecutive pair, and the two missing
configurations are genuinely different sets:

* **one** local direction `d` — the disk slit along the radius in direction `d`, a sector of
  full turn (`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_slit`);
* **no** local direction — the punctured disk, `x` being an isolated point of the skeleton
  (`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_punctured`).

Both are connected (`Schoenflies.isConnected_ball_diff_radial`,
`Schoenflies.isConnected_ball_diff_singleton`), which is everything the decomposition claims
about a sector, so the blueprint's clause holds at every point with a single sector. Both proofs
cut the set into convex pieces cut out by the sign of `Plane.det` and glue them along explicit
overlaps: no angle, no arctangent, no cyclic order.

The sectors are then named, for every point at once, as what
`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.connectedComponentIn_eq_cone` already proves them to be — the
connected components of the punctured disk:

  `Schoenflies.localSectors S x r : Set (Set Plane)`

with `Schoenflies.localSectors_finite`, `Schoenflies.sUnion_localSectors`,
`Schoenflies.localSectors_pairwiseDisjoint`, `Schoenflies.isOpen_of_mem_localSectors` and
`Schoenflies.isConnected_of_mem_localSectors`. In the generic case the members are exactly the
cones (`Schoenflies.cone_mem_localSectors`); in the degenerate cases there is exactly one
member (`Schoenflies.localSectors_eq_of_subsingleton`). A set of sets rather than an indexed
family, because the natural index — a consecutive pair of local directions — does not exist at
the two degenerate points.

## 2. Polygonal-side accessibility

`Graph.exists_access_segment` is the theorem, and it exports the *construction*: a point `y` of
the 2-cell `F`, as close to `x` as prescribed, whose straight segment from `x` lies in `F` apart
from `x` itself. `Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility` packages it as
`Schoenflies.PolyAccessible F x`. The length bound is not in the blueprint statement; the
shrinking-star arguments downstream need it, and it is free.

The blueprint's proof is followed step by step. Shrink the disk at `x` below the distance to the
compact wild curve `C` (`lem:compact-separation`(c)), so that inside it the whole skeleton
`K = |G| ∪ C` is just `|G|`; the punctured disk is then the union of the sectors; the sector
containing `y` is connected and misses `K`, so it lies in a single 2-cell, and that cell is `F`
because the sector meets `F` at `y` (`Graph.localSector_subset_cell` — this is the clause the
audit found missing from `Graph.exists_access_sector`); the straight segment from `x` to `y`
lies in that sector
(`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.openSegment_subset_connectedComponentIn`).

The case `x ∉ |G|` — not excluded by the statement, since `x` need only lie on the boundary of
`F` — is the degenerate configuration of part 1: the disk misses the skeleton entirely, is
itself the only sector, and `x` turns out to lie in `F`.

The sector is taken throughout as the connected component of `y` in the punctured disk, so the
*number* of local branches at `x` never enters the accessibility proof. Part 1 is what makes
that component a sector in the blueprint's sense — at a point with one branch or none there is
no consecutive pair of local directions to name it by, and the component is the whole punctured
disk.

## The one hypothesis

`Schoenflies.CellsAbsorb K cells` is `lem:cellulation-invariants`(i), *a connected set disjoint
from the skeleton lies in a single open 2-cell*, in the "meets, hence contained" reading. It is
the only thing assumed; two dischargers are supplied
(`Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent`, `Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent_in`), the
second of which covers the target side, where the 2-cells only fill an ambient region `Q` whose
frontier belongs to the skeleton.

## The target side

`Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility_target` and `Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility_square`.
The blueprint keeps a sector from leaking out of the square by applying `thm:polygonal-jordan`
to the square boundary; that is not needed here. The corresponding step is
`Schoenflies.subset_of_isPreconnected_of_frontier_disjoint` — a connected set missing the
frontier of an open set and meeting it lies inside it — together with
`Schoenflies.frontier_openSquare_subset`. Both are elementary, so the target side rests on
nothing beyond the shared hypothesis.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.isConnected_ball_diff_radial`, `Schoenflies.isConnected_ball_diff_singleton`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_slit`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_punctured`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.isConnected_ball_diff_of_subsingleton` — "consequently
  `B(x,r) \ |G|` is a finite union of open circular sectors" of `lem:local-skeleton-structure`,
  at the two points where `Schoenflies/SkeletonSectors.lean` leaves it open.
* `Schoenflies.localSectors` and its API, `Graph.IsDrawing.localSectors_finite`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.isOpen_of_mem_localSectors` — the same clause for a finite
  plane graph with polygonal edges.
* `Schoenflies.localDirs_union_of_disjoint`, `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.union_of_disjoint`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_isLocalRadius_union` — "shrink the disk at `x` until it also misses
  the compact set `C`; the disk then meets the whole skeleton in the finitely many radial
  segments" of `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`.
* `Schoenflies.CellsAbsorb`, `Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent`,
  `Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent_in` — `lem:cellulation-invariants`(i), assumed, and
  the two ways a cellulation discharges it.
* `Graph.localSector_subset_face`, `Graph.localSector_subset_cell`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.openSegment_subset_connectedComponentIn` — "each sector is
  connected and disjoint from the skeleton, so … lies in a single open 2-cell; and at least one
  sector lies in `F` … a short straight segment from `x` into that sector is a polygonal access
  arc" of `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`.
* `Graph.exists_access_segment`, `Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility` —
  `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`, source side.
* `Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility_target`, `Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility_square`,
  `Schoenflies.subset_of_isPreconnected_of_frontier_disjoint`,
  `Schoenflies.frontier_openSquare_subset` — "the analogous assertion holds at every boundary
  point of a target face" of the same lemma.

conditions on `Plane.det`, and both are used three times below. -/

/-! ### The disk minus one radius, and the punctured disk

`Schoenflies/SkeletonSectors.lean` decomposes the punctured local disk into the open sectors
between *consecutive* local directions, and that decomposition says nothing when there are fewer
than two directions to be consecutive. The two missing configurations are settled here: with one
local direction the punctured disk is the disk slit along a single radius, and with none it is
the punctured disk itself. Both are connected, which is everything the decomposition claims
about a sector, so the blueprint's clause holds at every point with the number of sectors equal
to one. -/

translate of an intersection of two convex sets. -/

`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_iUnion_cone` has to assume two branches.

The proof cuts the slit disk into three convex half-disks — the two open sides of the line of
`d`, and the open half-disk pointing away from `d` — and glues them along their two overlaps.
No angle and no cyclic order enters. -/

The only thing assumed in this module. It is *not* a restatement of the goal: it speaks about

invariant that another module is proving by induction over the two elementary operations. -/

`K`: *a connected set disjoint from the skeleton lies in a single open 2-cell.*

Stated in the "meets, hence contained" reading, which is the form the proof of
`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility` uses and which packages the word *single* — with the usual
`∃`-reading one still has to know that distinct 2-cells are disjoint before concluding that the
cell found is the prescribed one. It is discharged by
`Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent` (each 2-cell is a connected component of the
complement of the skeleton, which is what invariant (i) asserts) or, when the cells live inside
an ambient region whose frontier belongs to the skeleton, by

`lem:local-skeleton-structure`'s last clause, "consequently `B(x,r) \ |G|` is a finite union of
open circular sectors", now holds at *every* point of `|G|`: at a point with at least two local
branches the sectors are the cones of `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_iUnion_cone`, and
at the two degenerate points there is a single one. -/

/-- **The disk meets the whole skeleton in the finitely many radial segments.** The blueprint's
first step in `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`: at a point of the polygonal graph off the
compact wild set `C`, a small enough disk is a local disk for `|G| ∪ C`, not merely for `|G|`.

Not used below — the accessibility proof works with `|G|` inside the disk and disposes of `C`
by disjointness — but it is the blueprint sentence, and a consumer wanting the sectors of the
*whole* skeleton wants this. -/

The reasoning is the blueprint's, once the disk has been shrunk below the distance to the wild
set `C`: the sector is connected and misses the whole skeleton `K = |G| ∪ C`, so by
`lem:cellulation-invariants`(i) it lies in a single 2-cell, and that cell is `F` because the

/-- **The access segment of `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`, with a prescribed length
bound.** Let `G` be a finite plane graph with polygonal edges, `C` a compact set — the wild
outer curve — and `K = |G| ∪ C` the whole skeleton. Let `F` be an open 2-cell, and `x` a point
at which `F` accumulates, lying off `C`. Then arbitrarily near `x` there is a point `y` of `F`
whose straight segment from `x` lies, apart from `x` itself, inside `F`.

The straight segment is exported rather than the accessibility predicate, because the later
shrinking-star arguments need the access arc to be short; `PolyAccessible` follows in
`Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility`.

The proof is the blueprint's. Shrink the disk at `x` below the distance to `C`, so that inside
it the whole skeleton is `|G|`; then the punctured disk is the union of the sectors of
`Schoenflies.localSectors`, each of them connected and disjoint from the skeleton, and the one
containing `y` lies in a single 2-cell by the assumed `lem:cellulation-invariants`(i). That cell
is `F`, because the sector meets `F` at `y`. When `x` is not on `|G|` at all — which the
statement does not exclude, since `x` need only be a limit of points of `F` — the disk misses
the skeleton entirely and is itself the access region.

The sector is named as the connected component of `y` in the punctured disk, so no hypothesis
on the number of local branches at `x` is needed anywhere. -/

/-- **`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`, source side.** A boundary point of a 2-cell `F` of a
finite cellulation, lying off the wild outer curve `C`, is polygonally accessible from `F`.

`x ∈ closure F` is assumed rather than `x ∈ frontier F`: the proof never uses `x ∉ F`, and the
weaker hypothesis is what a consumer holding a limit of points of `F` actually has. -/

/-- **`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`, target side.** On the target every edge is polygonal,
including every outer edge, so there is no wild set to avoid; but the 2-cells only fill an
ambient region `Q` whose frontier belongs to the skeleton, and a sector at a boundary point of
`Q` may lie outside `Q` and belong to no cell. That is exactly what
`Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent_in` handles. -/

/-- `Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility_target` with the ambient region the open square. The
blueprint gets "a sector meeting `F` lies in `Q°`" from `thm:polygonal-jordan` applied to the
square boundary; here it comes from `Schoenflies.frontier_openSquare_subset` and the clopen
argument in `Schoenflies.subset_of_isPreconnected_of_frontier_disjoint`, so the polygonal Jordan
theorem is not needed. -/
