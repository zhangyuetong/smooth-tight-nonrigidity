# Corollary 2.9: alternating crosscuts intersect

Two crosscuts of a simple closed polygon whose four endpoints alternate around the curve, and
whose interiors lie on the same side of it, must meet.

## What the proof actually uses, and what it therefore assumes

The blueprint's proof is three sentences, and it uses exactly three things about the *second*
crosscut: its interior is connected, its interior lies in the same region of `ℝ² ∖ C` as the
first crosscut's, and its two endpoints are limits of its interior lying one on each of the two
arcs. **Nothing about the second crosscut is polygonal, and nothing about it is simple.** So the
core statement here, `IsPolygonalCrosscut.inter_cover_nonempty`, takes the second crosscut as a
bare preconnected set `Q` — the blueprint's `P₂ ∖ {endpoints}` — with two named points of
`closure Q`. This is not a weakening: the polygonality of `P₂` is a hypothesis of the blueprint's
corollary that its proof never consumes, and dropping it is what lets a consumer apply the
corollary to a *drawn* edge of a plane graph, which is a topological arc.

`IsPolygonalCrosscut.arc_inter_cover_nonempty` is the same statement with `Q` presented as
`P ∖ {w₁, w₂}` for a simple arc `P` from `w₁` to `w₂`, which is the blueprint's own reading; the
two hypotheses about `closure Q` are then automatic (`IsArcBetween.left_mem_closure_diff`).

## The alternation hypothesis

"The endpoints alternate around `C`" is, concretely, that one endpoint of the second crosscut
lies on the first arc and not the second, and the other the other way round. That is how the
core statement takes it. The packaged form `IsPolygonalCrosscut.alternating_inter_nonempty`
takes instead the shape a plane-graph argument produces — two arcs `A, B` meeting exactly in the
two cut points `{p, q}`, one endpoint in `A ∖ {p, q}` and one in `B ∖ {p, q}` — which is
verbatim the conclusion of `Graph.IsK33Config.chords_alternate`, and derives the
non-memberships from `A ∩ B = {p, q}`.

## The "same side" hypothesis, in three interchangeable forms

Theorem 2.8 is parametrized by a reference point `y` in the region of `ℝ² ∖ C` that the first
crosscut does *not* enter, so "the region the crosscut enters" is `farRegion C.carrier y`. The
second crosscut's interior has to lie there too. A consumer may supply that as

* `Q ⊆ farRegion C.carrier y` — the primitive form;
* `Q ⊆ connectedComponentIn C.carrierᶜ z` for some point `z` of the first crosscut off `C`
  — literally "both interiors lie in the same component", which is what a plane-graph argument
  has in hand (`IsPolygonalCrosscut.connectedComponentIn_cover_eq` converts it);
* `Q ⊆ inside C.carrier` with `y ∈ outside C.carrier`, or `Q ⊆ outside C.carrier` with
  `y ∈ inside C.carrier` — the blueprint's literal "the same one of `Int(C)`, `Ext(C)`".

## How the `K(3,3)` argument closes on this

`alternating_inter_nonempty` was written against `Graph.IsK33Config.chords_alternate`, and the
fit was checked: with `hK33 : Graph.IsK33Config G x y e`, `hd : Graph.IsDrawing G drawing`,
`hcross : IsPolygonalCrosscut C J₁ J₂ K a k yref` the realization of the chord `e s (s+1)` as a
crosscut, and `hside` the "same side" clause supplied by
`Graph.IsK33Config.exists_two_chords_same_side`, the last step is one term:

```
obtain ⟨A, B, hAarc, hBarc, hunion, hinter, hw₁, hw₂⟩ := hK33.chords_alternate hd s
obtain ⟨hA, hB⟩ := hreal A B hAarc hBarc hunion
exact hcross.alternating_inter_nonempty hA hB hinter
  (hd.edge_isArcBetween (hK33.isLink (s + 1) (s + 1 + 1))) hside hw₁ hw₂
```

with `hreal` the still-missing realization step: the hexagon, as a polygonal Jordan curve cut
into the two arcs `A` and `B`, presented as a `ClosedPolygon` with `C.arc a k = A` and
`C.arc (a + k) (m + 3 - k) = B`. Everything on either side of that step is in place. Note that
the two arcs must be obtained from `chords_alternate` *before* the realization, since it is
those particular sets the realization has to reproduce.

## Blueprint

* `IsArcBetween.isPreconnected_diff`, `IsArcBetween.left_mem_closure_diff`,
  `IsArcBetween.right_mem_closure_diff` — the interior of an arc is connected and has both
  endpoints in its closure. General-purpose; they belong in `Subarc.lean`.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.connectedComponentIn_cover_eq` — the region the crosscut enters is the
  component of any of its points off `C`.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.inter_cover_nonempty` — `cor:alternating-crosscuts`, core form.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.arc_inter_cover_nonempty` — the same for a second crosscut presented as
  a simple arc.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.alternating_inter_nonempty` — the same in the two-arcs shape that
  `Graph.IsK33Config.chords_alternate` produces.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.alternating_inter_nonempty_of_same_side` — the same with "both interiors
  lie in one component of `ℝ² ∖ C`" as the side hypothesis.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.alternating_inter_nonempty_inside`,
  `…_outside` — the blueprint's literal cases (a) and (b).
* `alternating_crosscuts` — `cor:alternating-crosscuts`, bundled.

`openArc f` is `f '' Ioo 0 1`; for an arc between two named points it is the arc minus those
points (`openArc_eq_diff`). The two facts the corollary needs — that the interior is connected,
and that each endpoint lies in its closure — are `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.isPreconnected_diff`
and `…left_mem_closure_diff` in `Schoenflies/Subarc.lean`, where three modules can share them.

/-- **Corollary 2.9, core form.** Let `K` be a crosscut of `C` cutting it at `a` and `a + k`, and
let `Q` be a connected set lying in the same region of `ℝ² ∖ C` as `K` — the interior of a second
crosscut. If `Q` has in its closure a point of the first arc that is not on the second, and a
point of the second arc that is not on the first — that is, if the endpoints of the two crosscuts
alternate — then `Q` meets `K`.

The proof is the blueprint's. By Theorem 2.8 the region minus the first crosscut is the union of
the two cells; `Q`, being connected and (for contradiction) missing the first crosscut, lies in
one of them; and the closure of that cell meets `C` in one arc only
(`IsPolygonalCrosscut.closure_cell_inter₁`), so one of the two named points cannot be there. -/

/-- **Corollary 2.9 (alternating crosscuts intersect).** Let `C` be a simple closed polygon and
`K` a polygonal crosscut of it cutting it at the vertices `a` and `a + k`, with `J₁` and `J₂` the
two closed polygons it forms with the two arcs `A` and `B`, and `y` a point of the region of
`ℝ² ∖ C` the crosscut does not enter. Let `P` be a second crosscut: a simple arc from `w₁` to
`w₂`, with interior in the same region of `ℝ² ∖ C` as `K`, and with its two endpoints alternating
with `K`'s around `C` — one interior to `A`, the other interior to `B`. Then the two crosscuts
meet.

The blueprint also assumes `P` polygonal and its four endpoints distinct. Neither is used: the
distinctness of the endpoints is subsumed by `w₁` and `w₂` being interior to different arcs, and
polygonality of `P` plays no part in the argument at all. -/
