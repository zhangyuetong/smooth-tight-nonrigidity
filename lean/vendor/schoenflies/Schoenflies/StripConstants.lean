# The constants of a polygonal collar exist

`Schoenflies.StripData` names the three numbers the two-sided strip lemma runs on — a cone
radius `R`, a trim `lam` and a half-width `rho` — together with the separation hypotheses they
have to satisfy. Everything in `Schoenflies/Strip.lean` is stated *for a given* `StripData`;
this module produces one, removing that parameter from the resulting theorem.

The recipe is the blueprint's own, in the blueprint's order:

1. `R` from three sources — the pairwise vertex separations, the distance from each vertex to
   each nonincident edge, and the prescribed open set — each an instance of Lemma 1.4, plus
   `R ≤ len i` so that a sector cannot run past the far end of an incident edge. The vertex
   separations are asked for with a factor `2` of slack, which is what the block-versus-sector
   estimates of `Strip.lean` spend.
2. `lam := R / 5`, which gives `2 * lam < R` and, through `R ≤ len i`, also `4 * lam < len i`.
3. `rho` from the distance of each *trimmed* edge to every other edge, and from the germ
   threshold `rho * (1 + |⟪r₁, r₂⟫|) ≤ lam * |det r₁ r₂|` at every vertex. The determinant is
   nonzero at a corner, so the threshold is a positive upper bound on `rho` and is met by
   shrinking; `rho < lam` is one more shrinking.

Steps 1 and 3 are finite families of positive bounds, combined by
`Schoenflies.exists_pos_forall_of_finite`.

## What simplicity is used for

Two of the separations are *false* for a self-touching closed polygonal curve, and each is the
exact point where `ClosedPolygon.edges_meet` is consumed:

* `ClosedPolygon.vertex_notMem_edge` — a vertex lies on no edge but the two incident to it.
  This is what makes `{vertex i}` and `edge j` disjoint compact sets.
* `ClosedPolygon.trimmed_disjoint_edge` — the trimmed core of an edge misses every other edge.
  Here the two endpoints allowed by `edges_meet` are excluded by the trim itself, since a point
  of the core is at distance at least `lam` from both.

`edges_meet` as stated is one-sided (`edge i ∩ edge j ⊆ {vertex i, vertex (i + 1)}`), but it is
quantified over all ordered pairs, so the symmetric instance is available and both proofs below
use whichever side is convenient. It carries enough simplicity for both statements.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.exists_stripData_subset` — the constants of Lemma 1.8 (Two-sided polygonal
  strips), chosen inside a prescribed open set containing the curve; this is the "Lemma 1.4 (a)
  lets all disks and strips be chosen inside the prescribed open set" of the last paragraph of
  the proof.
* `Schoenflies.exists_stripData` — the same without a prescribed open set.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.exists_cone_radius`,
  `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.exists_half_width` — steps 1 and 3 of the recipe, which are the
  instances of Lemma 1.4 that Lemma 1.8 consumes.
* `Schoenflies.StripData.nbhd_subset_thickening` — the collar of Lemma 1.8 lies in the
  `R`-neighbourhood of the curve, which is how the prescribed open set is honoured.

/-! ### What simplicity gives

The two statements below are the only consumers of `ClosedPolygon.edges_meet` in the whole
choice of constants, and neither is true without it. -/

/-- **Simplicity, first form.** A vertex lies on no edge but the two edges incident to it.
Without this the "a vertex is `2R` away from every nonincident edge" hypothesis of `StripData`
would be unsatisfiable, since the vertex would sit *on* one of those edges. -/

theorem isCompact_trimmed : IsCompact (P.trimmed i lam) :=
  isCompact_Icc.image (P.continuous_pt i)

/-- **Simplicity, second form.** The trimmed core of an edge misses every other edge. The two
common points `edges_meet` allows are the endpoints of the edge, and the trim removes them: a
core point is at distance at least `lam` from either endpoint. No lower bound on the edge
length is needed: if the trim eats the whole edge the core is empty. -/

/-! ## Where the collar lives

The collar sits inside the `R`-neighbourhood of the curve: a sector is inside a ball of radius
`R` about a point of the curve, and a block is within `rho < R` of the foot of its
perpendicular, which is on the curve. This is the whole content of "the neighbourhoods may be
chosen inside any prescribed open set containing the curve". -/
