# Continuity at the Jordan curve, and `thm:square-extension`

The last three statements of the manuscript: `lem:crosscut-side-correspondence`,
`prop:boundary-continuity`, and the assembly of `thm:square-extension` from them.

`Schoenflies/BoundaryContinuity.lean` proves the statement with the real combinatorial content,
`lem:skeleton-crosscuts` (`Graph.IsStageOn.exists_crosscut`), for one finite
plane graph. This module takes the crosscuts as given and finishes the section.

## The construction inputs

This module isolates the construction-dependent data as explicit hypotheses. They are supplied
for the quantitative stage recursion in `Schoenflies/InteriorHomeomorphism.lean` and
`Schoenflies/BoundaryAnchors.lean`. Nothing else is assumed: `thm:jordan` and
`thm:general-crosscut` are used through `Schoenflies/JordanClosed.lean`, where their hypotheses
are supplied.

* **`prop:interior-homeomorphism`** enters as `IsHomeoOn F F' (inside C) (Plane.openSquare 0 1)`
  — the `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` shape of `Schoenflies/Inversion.lean`: a map, a named inverse,
  and the continuity and inverse laws on the two sets.
* **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts` + `prop:skeleton-agreement`** enter as
  `Schoenflies.HasAnchorCrosscuts`: for two distinct anchors `a, b` a crosscut `P` of `C` from
  `a` to `b`, a crosscut `P'` of `Q°` from `u a` to `u b`, and the agreement
  `F '' (P ∖ {a,b}) = P' ∖ {u a, u b}`. This is exactly what the finite skeleton homeomorphism
  produces once `Graph.IsStageOn.exists_crosscut` has been run in the stage containing `a`
  and `b` (see `Graph.IsStageOn.exists_isCrosscut` below, which does the packaging).
* **`lem:anchor-density`** enters as the two clauses `𝒜 ⊆ C` and `C ⊆ closure 𝒜`, plus its
  "incident with a nonboundary edge" clause in the germ form `Schoenflies.HasSpokes`: at an
  anchor `c`, arbitrarily small connected pieces `J` of the Jordan domain which cling to `c`
  and whose `F`-images cling to `u c`. That is the initial subarc of the spoke at `c`, and its
  image, which is the initial subarc of the target spoke — the *only* use the blueprint makes
  of the spokes, in the paragraph of `lem:crosscut-side-correspondence` beginning "Choose
  `c ∈ 𝒜` in the relative interior of `Aᵢ`".

`Schoenflies.HasLimitHomeomorphism` bundles the four over all curves, and
`Schoenflies.squareExtension_of_hasLimitHomeomorphism` derives
`Schoenflies.SquareExtension` — the exact `def` of
`Schoenflies/Endgame.lean` — from it. The proof of `HasLimitHomeomorphism` assembled in
`Schoenflies/JordanSchoenflies.lean` closes the full theorem.

## The two arguments

*Which side maps to which side* is `Schoenflies.crosscut_side_correspondence`. The homeomorphism
of the interiors carries `Int(C) ∖ P` onto `Q° ∖ P'` (`Schoenflies.image_inside_sdiff`), hence
carries each of the two components onto one of the two; the labels are pinned by a spoke germ
`J` at an anchor `c` in the relative interior of `A₁`. `J` is connected, misses `P` because it
is small and `c ∉ P`, so it lies in one side; `c ∈ closure J` and `closure(Uᵢ) ∩ C = Aᵢ` force
that side to be `U₁`. The same two facts on the target, applied to `F '' J`, force `F '' U₁` to
be `U'₁`.

*Boundary continuity* is `Schoenflies.tendsto_nhdsWithin_inside`. The blueprint argues on a
subsequence; the filter form of the same argument avoids extracting one. If `F` does not tend
to `u p` along `𝓝[Int C] p`, then `l' = 𝓝[Int C] p ⊓ 𝓟 (F⁻¹ Wᶜ)` is a nonzero filter for some
open `W ∋ u p`, and compactness of `Q` gives a cluster point `q ∈ Wᶜ` of `F` along `l'`. If
`q ∈ Q°` then pushing `l'` through `F'` shows `p = F' q ∈ Int(C)`, impossible. Otherwise
`q ∈ S`; anchors `a, b` separating `p` from `r = u⁻¹ q` give a crosscut whose `p`-side contains
every point of `Int(C)` near `p`, so `l'` sits on that side, so `q` lies in the closure of the
corresponding target side, whose trace on `S` is `u(A₁)` — and `r ∉ A₁`.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsStageOn.exists_isCrosscut` — **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts`** repackaged as
  `Schoenflies.IsCrosscut`, the form `thm:general-crosscut` consumes.
* `Schoenflies.IsCutPair.separates`, `Schoenflies.exists_separating_anchors` — the selection
  step of `prop:boundary-continuity`: two anchors putting two prescribed points of the curve on
  opposite arcs. Uses **`lem:anchor-density`** through the density hypothesis alone.
* `Schoenflies.IsCrosscut.image_of_injOn`, `Schoenflies.image_sdiff_eq_of_eqOn` — the two
  steps a consumer performs to discharge `Schoenflies.HasAnchorCrosscuts` from a finite skeleton
  homeomorphism. No blueprint statement of their own; they are the second paragraph of the
  proof of **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts`**, "the finite skeleton homeomorphism sends `P` to a
  simple path `P'`".
* `Schoenflies.crosscut_side_correspondence` — **`lem:crosscut-side-correspondence`**.
* `Schoenflies.extendByBoundary`, `Schoenflies.tendsto_nhdsWithin_inside`,
  `Schoenflies.boundary_continuity` — **`prop:boundary-continuity`**.
* `Schoenflies.isHomeoOn_extendByBoundary`,
  `Schoenflies.squareExtension_of_hasLimitHomeomorphism` —
  **`thm:square-extension`**.

/-! ### Two elementary facts about the model square

`Q° = Int(S)`: the open square is the Jordan domain of the model curve. This is the bridge
between the shape `prop:interior-homeomorphism` is stated in (a homeomorphism onto
`Plane.openSquare 0 1`) and the shape `thm:general-crosscut` speaks in (`inside modelCurve`). -/

/-! ### Pushing arcs forward

`lem:crosscut-side-correspondence` labels the target sides by `u(A₁)` and `u(A₂)`, so the two
target arcs have to be produced as images. Nothing here is specific to the square. -/

/-! ### Anchors that separate

The selection step of `prop:boundary-continuity`. Given two distinct points `p, r` of the curve
and a dense set `𝒜` of anchors, we need anchors `a, b` with `p` and `r` on opposite arcs of `C`
from `a` to `b`. Density produces one anchor on each of the two open arcs of `C` from `p` to
`r`; the separation is then automatic, because an arc from `a` to `b` avoiding `p` and `r`
would be a connected subset of `C ∖ {p, r}` meeting both of its two (relatively open) halves. -/

/-- **A dense set meets the relative interior of either arc of a cut pair.** The one use
`lem:anchor-density` is put to. -/
theorem exists_anchor_mem_arc (hsub : 𝒜 ⊆ C) (hdense : C ⊆ closure 𝒜)
    (hcut : IsCutPair C a b A₁ A₂) : ∃ c ∈ 𝒜, c ∈ A₁ ∧ c ∉ A₂ := by

  obtain ⟨z, hzA, hz⟩ := not_subset.1 hcut.fst.not_subset_pair

  have hcC : c ∈ A₁ ∪ A₂ := by rw [hcut.union_eq]; exact hsub hc
  exact ⟨c, hc, hcC.resolve_right hcmem, hcmem⟩

/-- **Two anchors on opposite open arcs separate.** If `a` lies on the open arc `B₁ ∖ {p, r}`
and `b` on the opposite one, then any pair of arcs cutting `C` at `a` and `b` puts `p` and `r`
on different arcs.

The proof is the one separation argument of the section: an arc from `a` to `b` missing both
`p` and `r` is a connected subset of `C ∖ {p, r} = (C ∖ B₂) ∪ (C ∖ B₁)`, a union of two
relatively open pieces, and it meets both — because `a` is in the first and `b` in the
second. -/

/-! ### The hypotheses

Two predicates, one for each thing that is still being built. Both are *statements about one
curve*, so a consumer can discharge them curve by curve. -/

/-- **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts` together with `prop:skeleton-agreement`**, as
`lem:crosscut-side-correspondence` consumes them: any two distinct anchors are joined by a
crosscut `P` of `C`, whose image under the limit map is a crosscut `P'` of the open square from
`u a` to `u b`.

The agreement clause is stated on `P ∖ {a, b}`, which by `IsCrosscut.inter_eq` is exactly
`P ∩ Int(C)` — the part of the crosscut on which `F` is defined at all. -/
def HasAnchorCrosscuts (C 𝒜 : Set Plane) (u F : Plane → Plane) : Prop :=

    IsCrosscut C P a b ∧ IsCrosscut modelCurve P' (u a) (u b) ∧
      F '' (P \ {a, b}) = P' \ {u a, u b}

/-- **The spokes at the anchors.** At an anchor `c` there are arbitrarily small connected
pieces `J` of the Jordan domain clinging to `c` whose `F`-images cling to `u c`.

This is the germ of the nonboundary edge that `lem:anchor-density` attaches to `c`: `J` is an
initial subarc of that edge with the endpoint `c` removed, and `F '' J` is the corresponding
initial subarc of the target edge, which ends at `u c` because the finite skeleton
homeomorphism sends `c` to `u c`. Nothing else about the spokes is used anywhere. -/

  ∀ c ∈ 𝒜, ∀ ε > 0, ∃ J : Set Plane, J ⊆ inside C ∧ IsPreconnected J ∧ J ⊆ ball c ε ∧
    c ∈ closure J ∧ u c ∈ closure (F '' J)

/-! ### Discharging `HasAnchorCrosscuts` from a skeleton homeomorphism

The two steps a consumer has to perform, isolated so that they need not be reinvented: the
image of a crosscut under the finite skeleton homeomorphism is again a crosscut, and the
agreement clause follows from agreement of the limit map with that homeomorphism on the
crosscut. Neither says anything about the square, so both apply to the source and the target
side of any of the stages. -/

/-- **The image of a crosscut is a crosscut.** All that is asked of the map is continuity and
injectivity on a set containing the crosscut, plus the two clauses that are genuinely about the
target configuration: the image is polygonal, and everything but its two endpoints lies in the
target Jordan domain. -/
