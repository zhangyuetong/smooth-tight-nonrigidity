# The subdivided boundary of a square is a cycle

`Schoenflies.SquaresTwoConnected`, the last hypothesis between this library and
`thm:jordan`, discharged.

## What has to be built

`Schoenflies.squareGraph pieces points c r` is the part of a polygonal overlay lying on the
boundary of the axis-parallel square of `ℓ^∞`-radius `r` about `c`, when the four sides of that
square are among the overlay's source segments.  It is the subdivided boundary of the square,
so it is a cycle, and `Graph.IsLongCycle.isTwoConnected` finishes.  What is missing on `main`
is the **cyclic order** of the cut points: the graph is presented as a set of edges, with
nothing saying which edge follows which.

## The route

One real-valued coordinate does the whole of it.  `Schoenflies.sqCoord c r` is the *perimeter
coordinate*: the distance travelled from the north-east corner going counterclockwise round the
boundary, a number in `[0, 8r)`.  It is affine on each side, and it is the ordering tool of
`Schoenflies/SegmentOrder.lean` — distance from the side's first corner — with an offset.

* `Graph.IsIncWalk` is a walk along which a chosen real function strictly increases.  Such a
  walk is automatically a **path** (`Graph.IsIncWalk.isPath`): the freshness clause of
  `Graph.IsPath` says the vertex a step departs from is not visited later, and a vertex visited
  later has a strictly larger value.  This is the only place where "the cut points are in
  order" is turned into a combinatorial statement, and it replaces every argument about
  distinctness of vertices.
* `Schoenflies.exists_incWalk_of_chain` is the one-dimensional heart: a finite family of
  nondegenerate segments inside one ambient segment `[a, b]`, with pairwise disjoint interiors,
  with every end of every one of them interior to none of them, and covering `[a, b]`, is a
  **chain** from `a` to `b` — an `IsIncWalk` for the coordinate `dist a ·` whose edge list is
  exactly the family.  The induction is on the number of segments, and the step is
  `Schoenflies.exists_next_piece`: the piece leaving the current point is the one covering a
  point just beyond it, "just" being measured by the least end-coordinate strictly ahead.
* The four sides are chained separately and concatenated.  The concatenation is a closed walk
  at the north-east corner, so its last edge is split off (`Graph.IsIncWalk.split_last`) and
  becomes the distinguished edge of `Graph.IsCycleThrough`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.squaresTwoConnected` — the hypothesis `Schoenflies.SquaresTwoConnected` of
  `thm:arc-complement`, discharged.  In the blueprint this is the unstated step of
  "it follows inductively from `lem:union-two-connected` that `Γ_i` is 2-connected": the
  induction starts from one subdivided square boundary, and that it is a cycle is taken for
  granted there.
* `Schoenflies.exists_isLongCycle_squareGraph` — the cycle itself, with the clause that makes
  it usable: the cycle graph **is** `squareGraph`, not merely a subgraph of it.  A consumer
  wanting the boundary cycle of a square as an object, rather than 2-connectedness, takes it
  from here.
* `Schoenflies.exists_incWalk_insideEdges` — the subdivision of one source segment of a
  polygonal overlay, as a **path**.  `Schoenflies/SquareMeshConnected.lean` names exactly this
  as the theorem missing from `main` that blocks `prop:anchored-square-mesh` from being carried
  over to `Schoenflies.squareMesh`.  Its own ground is `Schoenflies.exists_incWalk_of_chain`,
  which knows nothing about overlays either.
* `Graph.IsIncWalk` — no blueprint statement; it is the device that makes
  `lem:polygonal-overlay`'s cut points into an ordered cycle.

/-- **The piece leaving the current point.**

Let `m` be the least coordinate of an end of a piece strictly ahead of `p` (the far end `b`
being counted, so that there is one).  A point `x` strictly between `p` and `m` is covered by
some piece; that piece's near end is at or before `p`, because it is at most `x`'s coordinate,
which is short of `m`; and it is at or after `p`, because `p` is interior to no piece and the
far end is beyond `p`.  So the near end **is** `p`.

Stated with explicit hypotheses rather than with `Schoenflies.IsPieceChain`, because it is
applied once at the current point and once at the point one step ahead, and at the latter
the family is no longer confined to what lies beyond. -/

/-! ## Part 3: the perimeter coordinate of a square boundary

The four sides of the square are axis-parallel, so on each of them the Euclidean distance from
the side's first corner is the difference of one coordinate.  `Schoenflies.sqCoord` glues the
four into one function on the plane: the distance travelled from the north-east corner going
counterclockwise.  It is `dist` from the side's first corner plus a multiple of `2r`, and that
is the *only* property of it that is ever used. -/

A nondegenerate straight segment inside the boundary of a square lies inside **one** side: its
midpoint is on the boundary, so one of the two coordinates is extreme there, and an average of
two numbers at most `c i + r` can only equal `c i + r` when both are.  That is
`Schoenflies.exists_side_of_mem_squareEdges`, and it is the only genuinely two-dimensional step
in the file. -/

Nothing about squares enters here.  `Schoenflies/SquareMeshConnected.lean` records this as the
theorem missing from `main` — "the subdivision of a segment at a finite point set is a path" —
that blocks `prop:anchored-square-mesh` from being carried over to `Schoenflies.squareMesh`. -/

/-! ## Part 6: the cycle, and `SquaresTwoConnected`

The four walks are concatenated into a closed walk at the north-east corner.  The perimeter
coordinate increases along the first three sides and along all of the fourth but its last step,
which returns to the corner where the coordinate is `0`; so that step is split off and becomes
the distinguished edge of `Graph.IsCycleThrough`. -/

/-- **The boundary cycle of a subdivided square.**  The whole of `squareGraph` is a cycle: an
edge `e`, a detour `D` running the other way round, and a third vertex.  The second clause is
what makes the first usable — `Graph.IsLongCycle.isTwoConnected` proves the *cycle graph*
2-connected, and here the cycle graph is the graph itself. -/
