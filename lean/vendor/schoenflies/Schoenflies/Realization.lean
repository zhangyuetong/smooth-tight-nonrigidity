# Realizing a polygonal Jordan curve as a `ClosedPolygon`

The blueprint's "simple closed polygonal curve" is set-theoretic: an `IsJordanCurve` that is
also `IsPolygonal`, with no condition on vertices at all. The development works instead with
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon`, a cyclic vertex list carrying a `corner` field — no three
consecutive vertices collinear. That field is a *presentation* condition, strictly stronger than
the blueprint's notion, and until now nothing said that a set-level polygonal Jordan curve
admits such a presentation. This module proves it.

## How the vertex list is found

The curve is *not* read off the vertex list `IsPolygonal` hands over: that list may retrace
itself, cross itself, and repeat segments, and it carries no order along the curve. Two
structures are laid over the point set instead and then matched.

* **From the plane side**, the overlay of `Schoenflies/OverlayGraph.lean`, with the graph
  discarded: `Schoenflies.IsClean` is a finite list of nondegenerate segments occupying the
  curve, with pairwise disjoint interiors and no end interior to any of them. Around an interior
  point of a piece the curve *is* that piece (`IsClean.exists_ball_subset_seg`), so the piece
  interiors are separated by honest open sets of the plane (`Schoenflies.nearPiece`) and a
  connected subset of the curve away from the ends lies inside a single piece.
* **From the curve side**, the loop's parameters at which it reaches an end of a piece. They
  form a finite subset of `[0, 1)` containing `0` — `0` because the loop's start is put on the
  cut list, so that the last gap is the one that closes the curve — and, listed in increasing
  order, they cut `[0, 1)` into gaps.

The two match: a gap image is connected and misses the ends, so it lies in one piece interior;
and the interior is connected and covered by the *closed* gap images, so it lies in that one
gap. Gaps and pieces therefore correspond one to one, the ends of a gap are the ends of its
piece, and the ends listed in the loop's order are a cyclic vertex list whose edges are the
pieces. That list satisfies `vertex_inj` and `edges_meet` but not `corner`, which is what
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon` is for; `corner` is then arranged by deleting redundant vertices.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon` — a `ClosedPolygon` less the `corner` field: the blueprint's simple
  closed polygonal curve *presented by a vertex list*, redundant vertices allowed.
* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.deleteLast`, `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_closedPolygon_of_prePolygon`
  — the blueprint's opening move in Lemma 1.8, "delete redundant vertices at which two
  consecutive edges are collinear", as an operation rather than an invariant.
* `Schoenflies.IsClean`, `Schoenflies.exists_isClean` — Lemma 3.7 (polygonal overlay) with the
  combinatorics dropped: what the overlay says about the point set alone.
* `Schoenflies.par`, `Schoenflies.parNext`, `Schoenflies.exists_mem_gap` — the parameters in
  increasing order, and that their gaps tile `[0, 1)`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_of_isJordanCurve`, `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon` — §1:
  every simple closed polygonal curve, in the blueprint's set-level sense, is the carrier of a
  `ClosedPolygon`.
* `Schoenflies.IsStraightAt`, `Schoenflies.IsCornerAt`,
  `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.exists_vertex_eq_of_isCornerAt`,
  `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` — the vertex set of a realization is *exactly*
  the set of points at which the curve does not run straight. So a named point can be required
  to be a vertex precisely when it is a corner, and no realization has any choice about it.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.rotate`, `…isArcBetween_arc`, `…arc_inter` — the two arcs of a
  splitting, as arcs between the two cut vertices meeting exactly there.
* `Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique` — two points cut a Jordan curve into two arcs in only one way.
* `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_corners`, `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_split`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs`, `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs_ordered` — the
  realization with named corners, with the splitting indices, and with the two arcs identified.
  The last is the shape `Graph.IsHexRealization` asks for.

## The corner hypothesis is not an artefact

`exists_closedPolygon_arcs` requires the two cut points to be corners.
`ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` shows that this cannot be dropped: every vertex of every
realization is a corner, so a cut point at which the curve runs straight is a vertex of *no*
realization, and no `ClosedPolygon` with that carrier has an arc ending there. A consumer that
needs to cut at a straight point has to change the curve — bend it there — which is a different
theorem, and is exactly the freedom `Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing` reserves for itself.

/-! ## Polygons before normalization

`PrePolygon` is `ClosedPolygon` with the `corner` field removed. Everything the curve bridge of
`Schoenflies/PolygonBridge.lean` proves about a `ClosedPolygon` — that its carrier is a Jordan
curve, that it is polygonal — uses only `vertex_inj` and `edges_meet`, so it is already true
here; what `corner` buys is the germ argument of the strip lemma, and nothing else. -/

/-! ## Recognising a redundant vertex

The `corner` field is `det ≠ 0` at every vertex. Where it fails the vertex is *interior* to the
segment joining its two neighbours, never an endpoint of it. That is the geometric content of
`edges_meet`: two edges leaving a vertex in the *same* direction would overlap in a
nondegenerate segment, and `edges_meet` would then put a whole segment inside a two-point
set. -/

/-! ## From a clean presentation to a cyclic vertex list

The loop reaches an end of a piece at finitely many parameters. Between two consecutive ones it
runs through one whole piece interior — the gap image is connected and misses the ends, so it
lies in one interior; and the interior, being connected and covered by the closed gap images,
lies in that one gap. So the ends, listed in the order the loop reaches them, are the cyclic
vertex list of a `PrePolygon` whose edges are the pieces. -/

A realization cannot put a vertex wherever it likes: `corner` forbids a vertex at which the
curve runs straight through. The points that *must* be vertices are exactly the ones at which
it does not, and this is what a consumer needing a named point to be a vertex has to check. -/

interior. -/

/-- **The realization theorem, tracking a splitting.** A polygonal Jordan curve decomposed into
two arcs meeting at two of its corners is the carrier of a `ClosedPolygon` whose two arcs at the
corresponding vertices are those two arcs.

This is the form the plane-graph layer wants — compare `Graph.IsHexRealization`. The corner
hypothesis on the two cut points is not an artefact of the proof:
`ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` says every vertex of a realization is a corner, so a cut point
that is *not* one cannot be a vertex of any realization at all. -/

/-- **The realization theorem, with the two arcs in the order they were given.** The same as
`Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs` with the disjunction moved off the arcs and onto the two
cut vertices: reading the polygon from the other cut point exchanges the two arcs, so exactly
one of the two starting vertices makes `P.arc a k` the *first* arc. This is the shape
`Graph.IsHexRealization` asks for. -/
