# Realizing a 2-cell split

`Schoenflies/CellulationInvariants.lean` proves the *step* theorems of the second elementary
operation: given a realization `R'` of `S.splitFace d` standing in the relation
`SplitData.IsCrosscutSplit` to a realization `R` of `S`, the two invariants of
`lem:cellulation-invariants` propagate. Nothing built such an `R'`. This module does.

## Blueprint

* `def:generated-structure`, operation 2 — the 2-cell split whose realization is constructed
  here.
* `lem:cellulation-invariants` (i), (vii) — the invariants that
  `SplitData.IsCrosscutSplit.isCellDecomposition_and_isFaceJordan` derives from the output of
  this module.
* `thm:general-crosscut` (`Schoenflies.crosscut_theorem`) — what turns the constructed ear into
  the two new open 2-cells; it is applied inside `IsCrosscutSplit.isRefinement`, and this module
  supplies its hypotheses.

## What is constructed

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.EarCrosscut` — the geometric input: an assignment of
  points to the ear's vertices and of parametrizations to the ear's edges, drawing the ear as a
  polygonal crosscut of the realized open 2-cell.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.realize` — the realization of `S.splitFace d` built from
  `R` and such an ear. It is a `def` with lemmas, not an existential: `splitPos`,
  `splitDrawing`, `splitCell` are its three components, each with its own reduction lemmas
  (`splitCell_face₁`, `splitCell_of_mem_cells`, `splitCell_earVertex`, `splitCell_earEdge`, …),
  and `realize_pos` / `realize_drawing` / `realize_cell` connect them to the record.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.isCrosscutSplit_realize` — the constructed realization
  stands in the relation `IsCrosscutSplit` to `R`. Composed with
  `IsCrosscutSplit.isCellDecomposition_and_isFaceJordan` this is the full induction step.

## What is assumed, and who discharges it

`realize` itself asks only for `EarCrosscut`, whose six fields — `pos_source`, `pos_target`,
`injOn`, `isDrawing`, `subset_face`, `polygonal` — say that the ear is drawn as a simple
polygonal arc from `R.pos d.source` to `R.pos d.target` whose interior lies in the open 2-cell,
plus the seventh, `disjoint_skeleton`, which is a fact about `R` alone and is discharged by
`Realization.disjoint_cell_skeletonSet` from assertion (i). A producer that starts from
`Schoenflies.exists_crosscut_of_polyAccessible` — a polygonal arc inside the face with both
ends on its boundary — and cuts that arc into the ear's edges has all seven in hand.

`isCrosscutSplit_realize` asks in addition only for `R.IsCellDecomposition D` and
`R.IsFaceJordan`.

It used to ask for a third thing — that the two boundary paths of the split 2-cell share nothing
but their two ends — because `SplitData` did not imply it: its field `paths_disjoint` forbade
the two paths a common *edge* but said nothing about a common interior *vertex*, and with a
common interior vertex the two realized paths meet in a third point, so the `IsCutPair` clause
of `IsCrosscutSplit` is false. That gap has since been closed at the source: `SplitData` now
carries `paths_meet` and derives `paths_disjoint` from it. What follows is the record of a
condition that
producer of the `SplitData` chooses them (as the two arcs of one boundary cycle) and so can
supply it. If a later wave prefers it as a field of `SplitData`, that is the right place for it.

## The general lemmas this needed

Three facts about drawings and paths had no home on `main` and are proved here in the root
`Graph` namespace. If a second consumer appears they belong in `Schoenflies/Graph/`:

* `Graph.IsPath.map`, `Graph.walkVertices_map`, `Graph.IsPathGraph.map` — a path pushes forward
  along an injective relabelling of the vertices. `Graph.IsWalk.map` was already on `main` (in
  `Schoenflies/CombinatorialInvariance.lean`); the path version needs the injectivity, because
  the freshness clause is a *non*-membership.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.isArcBetween_walkPointSet` — **the point set of a drawn path is a simple
  arc between its two ends.** This is the workhorse: it is what makes the realized ear an arc
  (so `IsCrosscut` applies) and what makes each realized boundary path an arc (so `IsCutPair`
  applies). The induction is on `Graph.IsPath`, and the freshness clause of a path is exactly
  what rules out the returning point that would break `IsArcBetween.concatenate`.

/-! ## The realization -/

/-- **The realization of a 2-cell split.**

The old realization `R`, a drawing of the ear as a polygonal crosscut of the old open 2-cell,
and assertion (i) at the old stage produce a realization of `S.splitFace d`:

* the ear's interior 0-cells go where the ear's drawing puts them, and its 1-cells to their
  open arcs;
* the two new 2-cells go to the two sides of the crosscut, `inside (Bᵢ ∪ P)`;
* every surviving cell keeps its old point set.

This is the object the whole split step of `lem:cellulation-invariants` was missing:
`SplitData.isCrosscutSplit_realize` puts it in the relation `IsCrosscutSplit` to `R`, and
`IsCrosscutSplit.isCellDecomposition_and_isFaceJordan` then propagates both invariants. -/
