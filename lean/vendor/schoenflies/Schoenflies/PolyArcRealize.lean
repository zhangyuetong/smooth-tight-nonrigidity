# Realizing a simple polygonal arc as a `PolyArc`

`Schoenflies/ArcCollars.lean` proves blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b) — the two-sided collar of an arc,
hence `Schoenflies.HasArcCollars` — for an arc *presented by its vertex list*, a
`Schoenflies.PolyArc`, and carries the presentation itself as the hypothesis
`Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier`. Nothing on `main` could supply that hypothesis for anything but
a straight segment, so `lem:crosscut-at-most-two` and `thm:general-crosscut` were not in fact
unblocked. This module closes the gap: a set that is both an arc between two points and
polygonal *is* the carrier of a `PolyArc`.

This is the arc analogue of `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon`, and the route is the one
`Schoenflies/Realization.lean` takes in the closed case, on a linear index instead of a cyclic
one. The closed-case machinery is reused verbatim wherever it does not mention the loop.

## The three steps

1. **Cut the point set into pieces.** `Schoenflies.exists_isClean` gives a finite list `Q` of
   nondegenerate segments occupying `P`, with pairwise disjoint interiors and no end interior to
   any of them; the two endpoints `a`, `b` of the arc are put on the cut list, so both are ends
   of pieces.
2. **Order the pieces along the arc.** The parametrisation `f` reaches an end of a piece at
   finitely many parameters; listed in increasing order they cut `[0, 1]` into gaps. A gap image
   is connected and misses the ends, so it lies in one piece interior; the interior is connected
   and covered by the closed gap images, so it lies in that one gap. Gaps and pieces correspond
   one to one and the ends, in the order `f` reaches them, are a *linear* vertex list.

   The only change from the closed case is bookkeeping at the far end. There the loop returns to
   `f 0`, so the parameters live in `[0, 1)` and the last gap wraps; here `f 1 = b` is a genuine
   extra vertex. Taking the parameter set to be `{t ∈ [0, 1) | f t` is an end of a piece`}` —
   *exactly* the set `Schoenflies/Realization.lean` uses — makes `Schoenflies.parNext` of the
   last index equal `1` by definition, which is precisely the missing right end. So
   `Schoenflies.par`, `Schoenflies.parNext` and `Schoenflies.exists_mem_gap` are used unchanged,
   and `n` parameters give `n` edges and `n + 1` vertices.
3. **Delete redundant vertices.** `Schoenflies.PreArc` is a `PolyArc` less its `corner` field,
   and `Schoenflies.PreArc.deleteVertex` removes one vertex at which the two edges are
   collinear. Each deletion shortens the list by one, so the induction terminates; unlike the
   cyclic case it can never get stuck, because a one-edge arc satisfies `corner` vacuously.

## Why the arc is not closed into a curve first

The tempting shortcut is to join `b` back to `a` by one extra polygonal path far from the arc,
apply `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs` to the resulting Jordan curve, and read the arc off
the cyclic list. It is circular. The return path has to meet `P` only at `a` and `b`, so it has
to leave `a` in a direction along which the arc does not run; knowing that there *is* such a
direction — that `P` is locally one segment at `a` — is a consequence of the realization, not an
input to it. A *straight* segment from `b` to `a` will not do either: an arc can perfectly well
cross the chord joining its endpoints. And avoiding `P` in the large needs `ℝ² ∖ P` connected,
which is `thm:arc-complement`, stated there with an explicit hypothesis. Route (A) below needs
none of this.

## Padding the vertex list

`PolyArc.vertex` is a function on all of `ℕ` asked to be *globally* injective — the convention
its docstring records, which supplies `A.tang i` and `A.len i` directly. A realization
produces `n + 1` vertices and nothing beyond, so the list has to be padded.
`Schoenflies.exists_injective_extend` does it once and for all, by walking off along the first
coordinate past every value the finite list takes.

## Blueprint

There is no blueprint label for this statement: like the closed-curve realization theorem of
`Schoenflies/Realization.lean` it is the bridge the blueprint takes for granted when it says
"let `P` be a simple polygonal arc with vertices `v_0, …, v_{n+1}`". Its consumers are
`lem:polygonal-collar` (b) and, through it, `lem:crosscut-at-most-two` and
`thm:general-crosscut`.

* `Schoenflies.exists_injective_extend` — a finite injective vertex list extends to an injective
  sequence.
* `Schoenflies.PreArc` — a `PolyArc` less the `corner` field: a simple polygonal arc presented by
  a vertex list, redundant vertices allowed. The arc analogue of `Schoenflies.PrePolygon`.
* `Schoenflies.skipIdx`, `Schoenflies.PreArc.deleteVertex`,
  `Schoenflies.PreArc.carrier_deleteVertex` — the blueprint's "delete redundant vertices at which
  two consecutive edges are collinear", as an operation. The arc analogue of
  `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.deleteLast`, and simpler: with a linear index no rotation is needed, so
  the vertex to be deleted stays where it is.
* `Schoenflies.PreArc.exists_polyArc` — the deletion run to completion. The arc analogue of
  `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_closedPolygon_of_prePolygon`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_preArc_of_isArcBetween` — steps 1 and 2: a set-level simple polygonal arc
  is the carrier of a vertex list. The arc analogue of
  `Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_of_isJordanCurve`.
* `Schoenflies.isPolyArcCarrier_of_isPolygonal` — **the realization theorem for arcs**, and the
  discharge of `Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier`.
* `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars_of_isPolygonal` — blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b) for a set-level simple
  polygonal arc, with nothing left standing.
* `Schoenflies.IsCrosscut.hasArcCollars`, `Schoenflies.crosscut_at_most_two_of_isPolygonal` — the
  same at the call site of `thm:general-crosscut`.

`PolyArc` asks for a globally injective `vertex : ℕ → Plane`; a realization only produces
`n + 2` points. The padding walks off along the first coordinate, past every value the finite
part takes, which keeps the extension injective and disjoint from the finite part. -/

/-! ## The index map of a deletion

On a linear index there is nothing to rotate: a vertex is deleted where it stands, and `skipIdx i`
is the inclusion of the shortened index set into the old one — the identity up to `i`, a shift by
one beyond it. It is the arc analogue of `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.emb`, and much simpler, because
that one has to wrap. -/

/-! ## From a clean presentation to a linear vertex list

The arc reaches an end of a piece at finitely many parameters. Between two consecutive ones it
runs through one whole piece interior — the gap image is connected and misses the ends, so it
lies in one interior; and the interior, being connected and covered by the closed gap images,
lies in that one gap. So the ends, listed in the order the arc reaches them, are the vertex list
of a `PreArc` whose edges are the pieces.

The parameter set is taken inside `[0, 1)`, exactly as in the closed case, so that
`Schoenflies.parNext` of the last index is `1` by definition. That is not a trick: `f 1 = b` is
the last vertex, and this is what puts it there. Both `a` and `b` are forced onto the cut list,
which is what makes `0` a parameter and `b` an end of a piece. -/
