# A simple arc does not separate the plane

`thm:arc-complement`.  Two points off a simple arc `A` are covered by a chain of small
axis-parallel squares strung along `A`; the two points lie in the outer face of every
consecutive pair of links, hence — by `lem:outer-chain` — in the outer face of the whole chain,
which is an open connected set missing `A`.  `lem:polygonal-connected` then joins them there.

## The single-ambient-graph obligation, and how it is met

`Graph.IsPlaneChain` requires every link `Γ i` to be a subgraph of **one** ambient plane graph
with **one** drawing.  A link built as the polygonal overlay of its own squares would *not*
qualify: the total overlay cuts those same segments at the crossings with the squares of other
links as well, so a sub-overlay has edges the total overlay has subdivided further.

The construction is therefore inverted.  `familyPieces c N r` is **one** list holding the four
sides of every small square; `familyOverlay c N r` is the one overlay of that list; and a link
is carved out of it by restricting the *edge set*:

* `segGraph S` — the plane graph spanned by a set `S` of straight edges, with the ends of those
  edges as vertices.  `overlayGraph pieces points = segGraph {Q | Q ∈ overlayPieces pieces
  points}` holds by `rfl`, so `segGraph_mono` turns a subset of the overlay's edges into a
  subgraph of the overlay with nothing to prove.
* `squareGraph pieces points c r` — the edges of the overlay lying on the boundary of the square
  of radius `r` about `c`, spanned.  It occupies exactly that boundary
  (`pointSet_squareGraph`), and every cut point on the boundary is one of its vertices
  (`mem_vertexSet_squareGraph`), which is what `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union` needs.
* `familyChain c N m r i` — the `i`-th link: `Graph.chainUnion` of the `m + 1` square graphs of
  the `i`-th coarse subarc.  Consecutive links share the square at the sample they have in
  common; nonconsecutive links are disjoint.

`isPlaneChain_familyChain` is the theorem that this family is a `Graph.IsPlaneChain`, stated for
an arbitrary family of centres `c : ℕ → Plane` with two geometric hypotheses — consecutive
centres closer than one radius, nonconsecutive-block centres further apart than two radii.  The
arc enters only in `exists_face_of_notMem_arc`, where `c j = α(j/N)`.

## What is assumed

Three hypotheses, all named in the statements that carry them.

* `SquaresTwoConnected` — **the part of a polygonal overlay lying on the boundary of one of its
  squares is 2-connected.**  That part is the subdivided boundary cycle of an axis-parallel
  square: four sides, cut at finitely many interior points, every cut point a vertex, the four
  corners among the vertices.  It is a cycle, so `Graph.IsLongCycle.isTwoConnected` finishes;
  what a discharger must build is the cyclic order of the cut points along the four sides, for
  which `Schoenflies/SegmentOrder.lean` is the tool.  Nothing about the arc, the chain or the
  outer face enters the statement.
* `Graph.CrosscutExists` and `Graph.CrosscutEncloses` — the two halves of the descent step of
  `lem:outer-chain`, quoted from `Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean` unchanged.  Because the chain is
  built from choices made inside the proof of `exists_face_of_notMem_arc`, they appear there in
  ∀-form: `CrosscutExists` conditioned on `Graph.IsPlaneChain` (which is how a discharger will
  state it) and `CrosscutEncloses` for every point.

## Blueprint

* `segGraph`, `squareGraph`, `familyPieces`, `familyOverlay`, `familySquare`, `familyChain` —
  the construction of the proof of `thm:arc-complement`: "around every sample draw the boundary
  of the axis-parallel square of `ℓ^∞`-radius `δ/4`, and let `Γ_i` be the polygonal overlay
  (`lem:polygonal-overlay`) of the square boundaries associated with `A_i`".
* `familyChain_isTwoConnected` — "it follows inductively from `lem:union-two-connected` that
  `Γ_i` is 2-connected".
* `isPlaneChain_familyChain` — "consecutive graphs `Γ_i, Γ_{i+1}` share the square at their
  common sample.  If `|i-j| ≥ 2`, then `Γ_i` and `Γ_j` are disjoint".
* `outer_of_notMem_closedSquare`, `outerOnPairs_familyChain` — "the graph `Γ_i ∪ Γ_{i+1}` is
  contained in the `ℓ^∞`-square of radius `3d` centered at `a_i` … both `p` and `q` lie outside
  this containing square and hence in the outer face of the pair".
* `notMem_face_of_mem_openSquare` — "if it lies inside, the boundary cycle of that square
  separates it from the outer face of `G`".
* `exists_face_of_notMem_arc` — the whole proof of `thm:arc-complement` up to the last sentence.
* `isConnected_compl_arc`, `exists_simple_poly_compl_arc` — **`thm:arc-complement`**: the
  complement of a simple arc is connected, and any two of its points are joined in it by a
  simple polygonal arc.

/-! ## Part 1: the subgraph of the plane spanned by a set of straight edges -/

/-- **The plane graph spanned by a set of straight edges.**  Its vertices are the ends of
those edges and an edge links its two ends in either order — the shape of
`Schoenflies.overlayGraph`, with the edge list replaced by an arbitrary set.

This exists so that a *part* of one overlay can be spoken about as a graph in its own right
while remaining a subgraph of the whole overlay (`segGraph_mono`).  Building the part as an
overlay of its own source segments would not do: the total overlay cuts those segments at more
points, so a sub-overlay is not a subgraph of it. -/

/-! ## Part 3: the chain of square boundaries

Everything here is about a family of centres `c : ℕ → Plane` and one radius `r`; the arc enters
only in Part 5, where `c j = α (j / N)`.  Separating the two keeps the single-ambient-graph
bookkeeping free of parametrisation arithmetic. -/

/-- **The one list of source segments**: the four sides of the square of `ℓ^∞`-radius `r`
about each of the centres `c 0, …, c N`.

The whole proof rests on this being *one* list.  A chain link built as the overlay of its own
squares would not be a subgraph of the total overlay, because the total overlay cuts those
segments at the crossings with squares of other links as well. -/

This is the obligation `Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean` flagged: every link must be a subgraph of
**one** ambient plane graph with **one** drawing.  It is discharged by construction — every link
is a `Graph.chainUnion` of `familySquare`s, and every `familySquare` is a `segGraph` on a subset
of the edges of the one overlay `familyOverlay c N r`. -/

/-- **The chain of square boundaries is a plane chain.**

The two geometric hypotheses are the blueprint's: consecutive centres are closer than one square
radius (`hstep`), and centres belonging to nonconsecutive links are more than two radii apart
(`hfar`).  Everything else — one ambient graph, one drawing, finiteness, polygonality — is
discharged by the construction. -/
