# The collar of a closed polygon is two-sided

`Schoenflies/Strip.lean` builds the blocks of Lemma 1.8 and proves the hard local half of the
statement: the two labelled sides are disjoint. This module closes the lemma for a *closed*
polygon by supplying the two remaining global facts.

* **Each side is connected.** The blueprint says "consecutive edge and vertex blocks overlap in
  a nonempty labelled half-strip, so the union of all left pieces is connected". Here that
  overlap is produced explicitly: `StripData.mem_overlapL_start` puts the point at frame
  position `(3 lam / 2, rho / 2)` in both `blockL i` and `sectorL i`, and
  `StripData.mem_overlapL_finish` puts the point at `(len i - 3 lam / 2, rho / 2)` in both
  `blockL i` and `sectorL (i + 1)`. The two `StripData` constraints that make these work are
  exactly the two the structure advertises for the purpose: `four_lam_lt_len` keeps the frame
  position inside the block, and `two_lam_lt_R` keeps it inside the sector, since
  `3 lam / 2 + rho / 2 < 2 lam < R`.

  The chaining is then a finite induction along `chainL`, and it does **not** need the
  wrap-around: connectedness of a union of connected sets only needs *some* spanning tree of
  the overlap graph, and the linear chain `0, 1, …, m + 2` is one. The blueprint's "the labels
  return consistently after one circuit" is a statement about the *labelling*, not about
  connectedness, and it is `Strip.sideL_disjoint_sideR`, already proved: it is what makes
  `sideL` and `sideR` two sets rather than one.

* **The collar is a neighbourhood, and removing the curve leaves exactly the two sides.**
  `StripData.nbhd_diff_carrier` is immediate from the two disjointness results of `Strip.lean`.
  Openness of `nbhd` is not: `nbhd` contains the curve, so it has to be recognised as a union
  of open sets. `StripData.nbhd_eq` does that, rewriting it as the union of the vertex balls
  and the full edge tubes; the two inclusions are `ball_diff_carrier_subset` and
  `tube_diff_carrier_subset` one way, and the covering of each edge by "near the first vertex,
  near the second vertex, or in the trimmed middle" the other way.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.StripData.isConnected_sideL`, `.isConnected_sideR` — "the union of all left
  pieces is connected; the same is true on the right", inside Lemma 1.8 (a).
* `Schoenflies.StripData.nbhd_diff_carrier` — `N \ P = N_L ⊔ N_R`, Lemma 1.8 (a).
* `Schoenflies.StripData.collar` — Lemma 1.8 (a) for a closed polygon, given the constants.

Producing the constants is `exists_stripData`, which lives elsewhere; every statement here is
for a given `D : StripData P`, exactly as in `Schoenflies/Strip.lean`.

`mem_edge_sub` and `mem_edge_pred_sub` read a point of an incident edge as a multiple of a ray.

/-! ### The overlaps

The blueprint's "consecutive edge and vertex blocks overlap in a nonempty labelled half-strip".
Both witnesses sit at across-coordinate `rho / 2`, at along-coordinate `3 lam / 2` from the
vertex in question. The two hypotheses of `StripData` that were put there for this are
`four_lam_lt_len` — which gives `3 lam / 2 < len i - lam`, so the point is inside the block —
and `two_lam_lt_R` together with `rho < lam` — which gives
`3 lam / 2 + rho / 2 < 2 lam < R`, so the point is inside the sector. -/

/-! ## Chaining a cyclic family

The union of the left pieces is connected because consecutive pieces overlap. This is a fact
about any cyclically indexed family, and it is worth isolating: it is used once on the left and
once on the right, and it is where the "cyclic" of the blueprint gets examined.

The point to notice is that the closing overlap `F (last) ∩ F 0` is **not used**. A union of
connected sets is connected as soon as the overlap graph is connected, and the path
`0 — 1 — ⋯ — N-1` already spans it; the extra edge back to `0` is a cycle, not a new vertex.
The blueprint's "the labels return consistently after one circuit" is therefore not needed
*here*: it is needed to know that the left label and the right label never collide, which is
`StripData.sideL_disjoint_sideR`, and that is already proved. -/

`nbhd` because its points off the curve are labelled (`ball_diff_carrier_subset`,
`tube_diff_carrier_subset`); conversely they cover `nbhd`, the only nontrivial part being that
they cover the curve itself, which is the three-way split of an edge into "within `R` of the

closed polygon is an open neighbourhood of the curve whose complement in it is the disjoint

`exists_stripData`, which produces the constants. -/
