# One positive bound for finitely many

Every "choose `ε` small enough for all of them" step in the development is this lemma: a
finite family of positive bounds has a single positive bound below all of them. The
polygonal-redrawing argument alone uses it three times, and the two-sided strip lemma chooses
its vertex disks and edge blocks the same way.

It is stated for a *predicate that is monotone downward in the bound* rather than as a `min`
fold, because no consumer wants the value — only that some positive value works for every
member at once.

## Blueprint

* `exists_pos_le_of_finite` — the numerical form.
* `exists_pos_forall_of_finite` — the form consumers use: a downward-monotone predicate
  holding at some positive bound for each member holds at one common positive bound.
