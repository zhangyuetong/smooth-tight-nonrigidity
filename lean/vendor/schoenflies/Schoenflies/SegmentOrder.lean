# Along one segment: the distance from an end as a coordinate

Everything the polygonal overlay has to say about several collinear segments — which piece
lies inside which, where a piece may end, when two pieces have to coincide — is
one-dimensional: it happens along a single straight segment. This module supplies the
coordinate that makes it ordinary arithmetic. Along a nondegenerate `segment ℝ a b` the
distance from `a` determines the point, and it reads betweenness off as a pair of
inequalities, so a claim about four collinear points becomes a claim about four reals.

No new geometry is needed. `dist_left_lineMap` already says the distance from `a` *is* the
parameter of `AffineMap.lineMap a b`, scaled by the segment's length, and `image_segment`
already says that parametrization carries segments of `ℝ` to segments of the plane. What is
added here is the translation, stated once so that the arithmetic does not have to be redone
at every use.

The two results the module exists for come last, and they are what makes cutting at every
meet enough:

* a piece that meets an overlap and keeps the overlap's ends out of its interior lies inside
  the overlap (`segment_inside_of_ends_outside`);
* two pieces whose interiors meet, each keeping the other's ends out of its interior, are the
  same pair of points (`same_ends_of_meeting_interiors`).

Both are stated **inside one ambient segment**. Collinearity is not optional: a piece crossing
the overlap transversally would meet it and avoid both its ends without lying inside it, so
every point named is a point of one ambient `segment ℝ a b`.

Both are also stated with no orientation asked of the caller. The `_oriented` forms they wrap
are near-end-first, which is what the arithmetic wants; the unoriented forms decide the
orientation themselves, and they are what the overlay uses.

## A note on degenerate pieces

Mathlib's `openSegment ℝ u u` is `{u}`, not `∅`. A degenerate piece therefore has a nonempty
interior, and the strict translation `dist_lt_of_mem_openSegment` genuinely needs `u ≠ v`.
The two headline theorems do *not* ask for it: in each of them a degenerate piece is either
excluded by the hypotheses or settled outright, and that case split lives inside the proof.

## Blueprint

* `segment_inside_of_ends_outside`, `same_ends_of_meeting_interiors` — the separation behind
  the deduplication clause of the polygonal overlay (`lem:polygonal-overlay`, "represent every
  duplicate geometric subsegment only once") and of the subdivision in
  `lem:polygonal-connected` ("delete duplicate subsegments"): once every piece's ends are cut
  points, and so interior to nothing, two pieces that share an interior point coincide instead
  of merely overlapping.

/-! ### The parametrization of a segment

`AffineMap.lineMap a b` walks from `a` to `b`. It carries a segment of `ℝ` onto the
corresponding piece of `[a, b]`, and it turns the distance from `a` into multiplication by
the segment's length. Those two facts are the whole content of the module; the rest is
arithmetic. -/

/-- The distance from the left endpoint to the point at parameter `t` is `t` times the
segment's length. This is `dist_left_lineMap` with the absolute value discharged. -/

/-! ### Where a point that is not interior to a piece must sit

These two carry the whole one-dimensional argument. A point of the ambient segment kept out
of a piece's interior has to be outside on one side or the other, and knowing which side it
is not settles it. -/

/-! ### The same two, asking the caller nothing about orientation

A piece is a pair of ends, and which of them is nearer `a` is none of the caller's business —
`segment` and `openSegment` do not care. The oriented forms above are near-end-first because
that is what the arithmetic wants; these decide the orientation themselves. Every hypothesis
is restated in both spellings first, so each of the four cases is just "which way round, then
cite". -/

inside it. -/
