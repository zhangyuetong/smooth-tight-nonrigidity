# Part I, with nothing assumed

The end of Part I. Everything below is already proved elsewhere; this module supplies the last
arguments and states the four headline theorems with no hypotheses at all, so that a consumer —
and the axiom audit — sees them in the form the blueprint states them.

Two hypotheses were carried, deliberately, across three waves of parallel work, under the
standing rule that a missing result is named rather than `sorry`-ed:

* `Schoenflies.SquaresTwoConnected`, in `Schoenflies/ArcComplement.lean` — a subdivided
  axis-parallel square boundary is 2-connected. Discharged by
  `Schoenflies.squaresTwoConnected` in `Schoenflies/SquareCycle.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier`, in `Schoenflies/ArcCollars.lean` — every simple polygonal arc
  is the carrier of a `PolyArc`. Discharged by
  `Schoenflies.isPolyArcCarrier_of_isPolygonal` in `Schoenflies/PolyArcRealize.lean`, the arc
  analogue of the realization theorem that `Schoenflies/Realization.lean` proves for closed
  curves.

Discharging the first makes `thm:arc-complement`, and with it `lem:accessible-dense` and
`thm:jordan`. Supplying the second removes the collar hypothesis from
`lem:crosscut-at-most-two`, and with `thm:jordan` that finishes `thm:general-crosscut`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.arc_complement` — **`thm:arc-complement`**: the complement of a simple arc in
  the plane is connected.
* `Schoenflies.jordan_curve_theorem` — **`thm:jordan`**: a Jordan curve separates the plane
  into exactly two regions, one bounded and one unbounded, each with the curve as its boundary.
  Stated as `IsSeparating C`, the same predicate `thm:polygonal-jordan` uses, so that every
  consumer written against the polygonal case applies verbatim.
* `Schoenflies.crosscut_theorem`, `Schoenflies.crosscut_theorem_three_regions` —
  **`thm:general-crosscut`**.

/-- **`thm:jordan`, the Jordan curve theorem.** The complement of a Jordan curve has exactly two
regions, one bounded and one unbounded, and both have the curve as their boundary.

`IsSeparating` packages all of that, and is the same predicate the polygonal case
(`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.polygonal_jordan`) is stated through — so `Schoenflies.inside`,
`Schoenflies.outside` and the whole region API of `Schoenflies/CrosscutCells.lean` apply to a
general Jordan curve with nothing to transport. -/

/-- **`thm:general-crosscut`, first sentence.** A polygonal crosscut of a Jordan domain cuts it
into exactly two components, the interiors of the two curves the crosscut makes with the two
arcs of `C`. The two sides are labelled by which arc of `C` their closure meets. -/
