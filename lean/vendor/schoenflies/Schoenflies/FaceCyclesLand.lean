# `lem:face-cycles`, with nothing assumed

`Schoenflies/FaceCyclesProof.lean` proves `lem:face-cycles` modulo one hypothesis,
`Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`: the exhaustion clause of `thm:polygonal-crosscut` for a
crosscut whose two endpoints are *arbitrary points* of the curve. This module proves that
hypothesis and restates the lemma without it (`Graph.face_cycles'`,
`Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_union'`).

## Why the crosscut theorem had to be redone, and how far

`main`'s Theorem 2.8 (`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut`) cuts a `ClosedPolygon` at two of *its
vertices*, and `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` says a point at which the curve runs
straight is a vertex of no `ClosedPolygon` presentation of it. In the ear induction the two cut
points are graph vertices, at which the two cycle edges may leave along opposite rays. So the
presentation has to be `Schoenflies.PrePolygon`, which has no `corner` field, and the two `main`
hypotheses `edges₁`/`edges₂` — multiset equalities `SameEdges Jᵢ.pieces (Aᵢ ++ K)` — have to go
as well, for the reason `Schoenflies/FaceCyclesProof.lean` records: the merged curve `Aᵢ ∪ P` may
run straight through a cut point, and then no presentation of it has an edge ending there.

Both go away at once by never realizing `J₁` and `J₂` at all. The two curves of the split are
given by *literal* edge lists `Aᵢ ++ K`, so Lemma 2.7 (`Schoenflies.parity_split`) applies with
nothing to check, and only the *easy* half of Theorem 2.3 is asked of them: "points in the same
region have the same crossing count", which is Lemma 2.2
(`Schoenflies.parity_eq_of_mem_connectedComponentIn`) and needs no realization. The hard half —
the two values `0` and `1` — is needed for `J` alone, where
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.parity_eq_one_iff` of `Schoenflies/PrePolygonSep.lean` supplies it. That
is the whole of the reduction; Lemma 2.6 (`Schoenflies.crosscut_cells`) is already stated at the
set level and is quoted unchanged.

What the presentation still has to do is put the two cut points *on* its vertex list, and that is
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.insertLast` of `Schoenflies/PrePolygonArc.lean`, the inverse of
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.deleteLast`. A point interior to an edge is brought to the last edge by
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.rotate` and the edge is split in two; simplicity survives because the far
end of the split edge lies on neither half.

## For the integrator

The `Schoenflies.PrePolygon` arc apparatus this module runs on —
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.arcPieces`, `…arc`, `…arcList`, `…insertLast` and
`Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_split` — lives in `Schoenflies/PrePolygonArc.lean`, shared with
`Schoenflies/Graph/K33Land.lean`. It is `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.arcPieces` and its API of
`Schoenflies/ParitySplitting.lean` and `Schoenflies/Realization.lean` transcribed with the
structure changed — the proofs use `vertex_inj` and `edges_meet` and nothing else. The right
arrangement, as `Schoenflies/PrePolygonSep.lean` already says of `pieces`, is to prove them once
for `PrePolygon` and define the `ClosedPolygon` versions as `P.toPre.arcPieces`; that needs
`PrePolygon` moved up beside `ClosedPolygon` in `Schoenflies/Strip.lean`.

Three declarations here are general and belong elsewhere:
`Schoenflies.isSeparating_of_isJordanCurve` in `Schoenflies/Realization.lean`,
`Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.ne` in `Schoenflies/Curve.lean`, and
`Schoenflies.isChainFrom_segsOf` in `Schoenflies/ParitySplitting.lean` beside
`Schoenflies.isChainFrom_pathPieces`. `Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique_of_isClosed` subsumes
`Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique` and should replace it in `Schoenflies/Realization.lean`.

Once this module is moved above `Schoenflies/FaceCyclesProof.lean`, the hypothesis
`Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion` can be deleted from `Graph.face_cycles` and
`Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_union`, and the two primed statements at the end here dropped.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique_of_isClosed` — the two arcs a pair of points cuts a curve into are
  determined, with the competing splitting known only to be closed and nondegenerate.
* `Schoenflies.crosscutSplitsRegion` — the exhaustion clause of `thm:polygonal-crosscut` at
  arbitrary cut points: `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`, proved.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_union'` — one ear of `lem:face-cycles`.
* `Graph.face_cycles'` — **`lem:face-cycles`**.
* `Graph.IsFaceCycle.eq_inside_of_isBounded'` — "in particular, every bounded face is the
  interior of its boundary cycle".

/-! ## Theorem 2.8 at arbitrary cut points

The blueprint's Theorem 2.8 is proved on `main` for a crosscut cutting a `ClosedPolygon` at two
of *its vertices*; `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` makes that a real restriction,
since a point where the curve runs straight is a vertex of no `ClosedPolygon` presentation. The
exhaustion clause is what a consumer splitting a face at two graph vertices needs, and here it is
proved with no condition on the two points beyond lying on the curve.

The route is the blueprint's, with `PrePolygon` in place of `ClosedPolygon` and with the two
`Schoenflies.SameEdges` hypotheses of `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut` replaced by *literal*
edge lists: the two curves of the split are presented as `Aᵢ ++ K`, so Lemma 2.7
(`Schoenflies.parity_split`) applies with nothing to check. Only one direction of Theorem 2.3 is
needed for those two lists — "the same region forces the same count", which is Lemma 2.2 and asks
for no realization at all. The other direction is needed only for the curve `C` itself, and there
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.parity_eq_one_iff` supplies it. -/

`Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_union` and `Graph.face_cycles` of

`Schoenflies.crosscutSplitsRegion` above proves it, so here are the two statements with the

`PrePolygon` development is hoisted above `Schoenflies/FaceCyclesProof.lean` the hypothesis can
