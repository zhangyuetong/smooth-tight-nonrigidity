# Separating curves, absorption, and the two cells of a crosscut

Definition 2.4 calls a Jordan curve *separating* when its complement has exactly two regions,
one bounded and one unbounded, each with the curve as its boundary. Everything Part I proves
about a polygonal curve and Part II proves about a general one is packaged in that single
predicate, and the two lemmas below are the ones needed on both sides of the divide: they are
proved from the definition alone.

## The interface: `inside` and `outside` are total functions

The blueprint writes `Int(C)` and `Ext(C)` for the two regions and its consumers — the two
crosscut theorems — name them in their *statements*. So the two regions must be functions of
`C`, not sets produced by an existential inside the definition of separation. They are defined
here for an arbitrary set: `inside C` is the union of the bounded components of the complement
and `outside C` the union of the unbounded ones; together they partition `Cᶜ`.
Separation is then the assertion that each of the two halves is *one* region with boundary `C`
(Definition 2.4); that one is bounded and the other unbounded is then automatic, and so is
"exactly two regions", since a connected clopen piece of `Cᶜ` is a component of it.

`IsRegionOf C Ω` says `Ω` is one of the two, and `IsRegionPair C Ω Ω'` that `Ω, Ω'` are the two
in one order or the other. That is what lets Lemma 2.6 be stated once instead of twice: the
blueprint's `Ω` is sometimes `Int(C)` and sometimes `Ext(C)`, and every step of its proof is
symmetric in that choice.

## What the crosscut lemma actually needs

Lemma 2.6 is stated for a crosscut `P` of a separating curve `C` with arcs `A₁, A₂`, but its
proof never uses that `P` and the `Aᵢ` are arcs, nor the endpoints `p, q`, nor even that
`C = A₁ ∪ A₂`. What it uses is: `Aᵢ ⊆ C`, `P ∩ C ⊆ Aᵢ` (the crosscut meets the curve only in
the shared endpoints, which lie on both arcs), `Jᵢ = Aᵢ ∪ P` separating, and `A₁ ≠ A₂`. The
lemmas below are therefore stated at that level of generality, with `arcs_ne` supplying
`A₁ ≠ A₂` from the arc picture and `isJordanCurve_union` supplying the sentence "these are
Jordan curves" from `IsJordanCurve.of_two_arcs`.

One further hypothesis of the blueprint is dropped: `Ω` is described there as the region
containing `P ∖ {p, q}`, but what actually pins the roles of `Ω`, `Ω†`, `Wᵢ` and `Vᵢ` is the
inclusion `Ω† ⊆ Wᵢ`, which is a hypothesis here. A consumer supplies it by
`IsSeparating.exists_isRegionPair_subset`, which is the formal content of the blueprint's
"being connected it lies in one region of `ℝ² ∖ Jᵢ`, so `Wᵢ` and `Vᵢ` are well defined".

## Blueprint

* `inside`, `outside`, `IsSeparating` — Definition 2.4 (separating Jordan curve).
* `IsSeparating.absorption` — Lemma 2.5 (absorption).
* `crosscut_cells` — Lemma 2.6 (crosscut cells), all three parts, with the per-part lemmas
  `cell_subset_region_diff`, `cell_isComponent`, `closure_cell_inter_curve` stated separately
  because the bundled form carries the hypotheses of both indices at once.

/-! ### Definition 2.4: a separating Jordan curve -/

/-- Definition 2.4. A Jordan curve is *separating* when its complement has exactly two regions,
one bounded and one unbounded, each with boundary `C`.

Since `inside C` and `outside C` always partition the complement into the bounded-component
part and the unbounded-component part, "exactly two regions, one bounded and one unbounded"
says precisely that each part is a single region; and the boundedness of one and unboundedness
of the other are then consequences rather than hypotheses (`IsSeparating.isBounded_inside`,
`IsSeparating.not_isBounded_outside`). -/
