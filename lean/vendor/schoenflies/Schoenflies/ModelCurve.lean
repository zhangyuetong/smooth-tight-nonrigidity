# The model curve, and the parametrization of a Jordan curve by it

The blueprint's model curve is `S = ∂Q`, the boundary of the square `Q = [-1,1]²`, and *not*
the unit circle. That is a deliberate choice: this development is trigonometry-free, so a
traversal of the round circle by an interval is unavailable, whereas `S` is four segments
glued end to end and each segment is an arc by `isArcBetween_segment`. The blueprint says so
explicitly ("Nothing in this document needs the unit circle in place of `S`").

`modelCurve` is defined by the sup norm, `‖x‖∞ = 1`, which is the same square the rest of the
development already speaks about (`Plane.closedSquare 0 1`), and it is cut into its four sides
by `modelCurve_eq_sides`.

## The content of Lemma 3.1

The lemma has three clauses. Only the first is proved here; the other two are already on
`main`, transported along the homeomorphism the first clause supplies:

* *"`γ` induces a homeomorphism from `S` onto `C`"* — `isJordanCurve_modelCurve` together with
  `IsJordanCurve.homeomorph_modelCurve`. The general fact behind it is `IsLoop.exists_homeomorph`:
  a loop is a quotient map of `[0,1]` which identifies exactly `0` with `1`, so *any two* loops
  induce a homeomorphism between their images, matching parameter for parameter.
* *"two distinct points divide `C` into two simple arcs meeting exactly in those points"* — this
  is `IsJordanCurve.two_arcs` in `Schoenflies/TwoArcs.lean`, proved directly on the parameter
  interval, which is strictly stronger than transporting it from `S`.
* *"the relatively open subarcs form a basis of the subspace topology"* — `openArc_isRelOpen`,
  `openArc_subarc_isRelOpen` and `basic_piece_inside_ball` in `Schoenflies/Subarc.lean`.

The route to the homeomorphism is the blueprint's, with the sequence argument replaced by its
point-set content: `t ↦ γ t` is a continuous surjection from the compact `[0,1]` onto the
Hausdorff `C`, hence a closed map, hence a *quotient* map; so a map out of `C` is continuous as
soon as its composite with the parametrization is. That is exactly what the blueprint's
subsequence chase establishes, and it is one line here.

## Blueprint

* `modelCurve` — Lemma 3.1, the model curve `S = ∂Q` with `Q = [-1,1]²`.
* `modelCurve_eq_sides` — the decomposition of `S` into its four sides.
* `modelCurve_eq_frontier` — `S` is literally the topological boundary of `Q`.
* `isJordanCurve_modelCurve` — `S` is a Jordan curve.
* `IsLoop.param_eq_or`, `IsLoop.eq_of_eq` — a loop identifies exactly the two endpoints of the
  parameter interval.
* `IsLoop.exists_homeomorph` — two loops induce a homeomorphism of their images.
* `IsJordanCurve.homeomorph`, `IsJordanCurve.homeomorph_modelCurve`,
  `IsJordanCurve.modelCurve_homeomorph` — Lemma 3.1, first clause.

curve. This is the form the blueprint states — `γ` induces a homeomorphism from `S` onto
`C`. -/
