# Separation and crossing parity before normalization

`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` carries a `corner` field — no three consecutive vertices collinear —
and `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` shows that field is not slack: a point at which
the curve runs straight is a vertex of *no* `ClosedPolygon` presentation of it. So a consumer that
must present a curve with vertices at prescribed points cannot use `ClosedPolygon` at all, and the
plane-graph arguments are exactly such consumers: the branch points of a drawing land wherever the
drawing puts them.

`Schoenflies.PrePolygon` is the presentation without that field, and vertices may be put anywhere.
This module gives it everything the crosscut chain asks of a simple closed polygon: an edge list
for the crossing count, the curve statements, the polygonal Jordan curve theorem, and the two
parity values.

## Everything transports across normalization, except the parity

`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_closedPolygon_of_prePolygon` deletes redundant vertices and returns
a genuine `ClosedPolygon` **with the same carrier**. Any property of the carrier *as a set* is
therefore free: `isJordanCurve_carrier`, `isPolygonal_carrier` and `isSeparating_carrier` below are
each three lines, and none of them needs a word about vertices.

The crossing parity is not a property of the carrier. It is computed from a *list of edges*, and
normalization changes that list: it merges collinear edges, so `P.pieces` is a subdivision of the
normalized polygon's. Lemma 2.1 (`Schoenflies.parity_subdivide`) says subdivision does not change
the parity, which is why one *expects* the parity to transport — but the normalization theorem is
an existence statement and keeps no record of which points were deleted, so there is no
subdivision in hand to feed it. See the note at the end of this docstring.

The parity is therefore re-derived here, and the derivation turns out not to need the collar at
all. Once the curve is known to separate, the two values are forced:

* far along the ray direction the count is zero, and the half-plane where it is zero is convex and
  unbounded, hence lies in the unbounded region — so `π_C = 0` on the outside;
* across an interior point of any one edge the count jumps by one (Lemma 2.2), and the two test
  points lie off the curve, so they lie in different regions — so the other region carries `1`.

Both steps are stated for an arbitrary closed chain whose cover separates the plane
(`Schoenflies.parity_eq_zero_of_mem_outside_cover`, `…parity_eq_one_of_mem_inside_cover`); the
`PrePolygon` statements are instances. **The `ClosedPolygon` versions in
`Schoenflies/PolygonalJordan.lean` are instances too** — `ClosedPolygon.parity_eq_one_of_mem_inside`
currently goes through `StripData`, and does not have to.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.pieces`, `…cover_pieces`, `…isClosedChain_pieces`, `…pieces_nondeg` —
  the edge list the crossing count of §2 is defined on, for a vertex list that has not been
  normalized. Same list as `ClosedPolygon.pieces`; `PrePolygon.pieces_toPre` is `rfl`.
* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.isJordanCurve_carrier`, `…isPolygonal_carrier` — §1, "a simple closed
  polygonal curve"; jointly the hypothesis of Theorem 2.3.
* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.isSeparating_carrier` — **Theorem 2.3** in the form Definition 2.4 asks
  for, for a polygon presented with redundant vertices.
* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.parity_flip_carrier` — Lemma 2.2, second half.
* `Schoenflies.parity_eq_zero_of_mem_outside_cover`,
  `Schoenflies.parity_eq_one_of_mem_inside_cover` — the last sentence of Theorem 2.3, for an
  arbitrary closed chain whose cover separates.
* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.parity_eq_zero_of_mem_outside`, `…parity_eq_one_of_mem_inside`,
  `…parity_eq_zero_iff`, `…parity_eq_one_iff` — the same, read off a `PrePolygon`.

## Two notes for the integrator

**`PrePolygon.pieces` duplicates `ClosedPolygon.pieces`.** The two definitions are literally the
same expression and `PrePolygon.pieces_toPre` proves them equal by `rfl`. The right arrangement is
to define `ClosedPolygon.pieces P := P.toPre.pieces` and to keep only the `PrePolygon` proofs — the
proofs of `cover_pieces`, `isClosedChain_pieces`, `pieces_nondeg`, `pieces_nodup`,
`notMem_edge_of_mem_openSegment` and `parity_flip_carrier` in `Schoenflies/PolygonBridge.lean` use
`vertex_inj` and `edges_meet` and nothing else, so they are the proofs below with `ClosedPolygon`
written for `PrePolygon`. That refactor cannot happen inside this module: `PrePolygon` is declared
in `Schoenflies/Realization.lean`, which is *downstream* of `PolygonBridge`. It needs `PrePolygon`
moved up beside `ClosedPolygon` in `Schoenflies/Strip.lean`.

**Merging collinear edges is a subdivision, but not one this development can point at.** Deleting
a redundant vertex `v` replaces the two edges at `v` by their union, which is exactly undoing
`Schoenflies.splitAt v` on the merged edge; iterating, `P.pieces` is `subdivide P'.pieces vs` for
the list `vs` of deleted vertices — *up to the order of the list*, which `rotate` disturbs. So two
things are missing before `parity_subdivide` could be used here: `Schoenflies.parity` invariance
under `List.Perm` (immediate, `parity` is a sum over the list), and a strengthening of
`exists_closedPolygon_of_prePolygon` to
`∃ m' (P' : ClosedPolygon m') (vs : List Plane), P'.carrier = P.carrier ∧
  P.pieces ~ subdivide P'.pieces vs`, carried through the induction. The direct argument below is
shorter than either.

/-! ## The `ClosedPolygon` parity values are instances

A machine check of the claim made in this module's docstring. `Schoenflies/PolygonalJordan.lean`
proves `ClosedPolygon.parity_eq_one_of_mem_inside` from a `StripData` — the collar of Lemma 1.8,
which is where `corner` is used. The collar is needed for Theorem 2.3 itself, but *not* a second
time for the parity value: given separation, the two values follow from the general lemmas above.
The two `example`s below are the same statements, re-proved that way. -/
