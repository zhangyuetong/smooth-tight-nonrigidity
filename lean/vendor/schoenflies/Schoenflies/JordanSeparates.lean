# A Jordan curve separates the plane

Half of the Jordan curve theorem: the complement of a Jordan curve `C` is disconnected. The
proof is the blueprint's — build a subdivision of `K(3,3)` out of the curve, a chord of it, a
detour above it, and a connecting arc, and appeal to `Graph.IsArcK33.elim`.

## The configuration

Fix a coordinate `i` in which `C` has nonzero width, and let `j` be the other one. Write `m`
and `M` for the extreme `i`-coordinates on `C`, and let `p₁`, `p₂` be the points of `C` on the
two supporting lines `{z | z i = m}`, `{z | z i = M}` with the largest `j`-coordinate. Two
points of a Jordan curve cut it into two arcs `C₁`, `C₂` (`IsJordanCurve.two_arcs`). Both meet
the middle line `{z | z i = (m + M) / 2}`, by the intermediate value theorem; a closest pair
`a ∈ C₁`, `b ∈ C₂` on that line spans a segment `L₄` whose interior misses `C`. Running up the
two supporting lines and across above the curve gives a polygonal set meeting `C` exactly in
`{p₁, p₂}` and missing `L₄`; a simple arc `L₅` inside it (`exists_simple_poly_of_poly`) is the
blueprint's detour.

The blueprint argues inside the unbounded component: it supposes `L₄ \ {a, b}` to lie there,
and concludes that it does not. Here the contradiction hypothesis is the statement being
negated — that the whole complement is preconnected — which is weaker to assume and gives the
same `K(3,3)`. Nothing about the unbounded component is needed, so nothing about it is proved;
`exists_unique_unbounded_connectedComponentIn_compl` at the end is the separate cheap fact.

*If* the complement were preconnected, a simple polygonal arc `R` inside it would join an
interior point of `L₄` to an interior point of `L₅`. Its last parameter on `L₄` and the first
one after that on `L₅` cut out a piece `L₆` meeting `L₄ ∪ L₅` only at its two ends — this is
why the blueprint takes such care over the order in which `c'` and `d'` are chosen. Cutting
`C₁` at `a`, `C₂` at `b`, `L₅` at the far end `d'` of `L₆` and `L₄` at its near end `c'`
produces nine arcs on the six points `{p₁, p₂, c'}`, `{a, b, d'}`, meeting only where a
`K(3,3)` forces them to. That is impossible, so the complement is not preconnected.

## Coordinates instead of a rotation

The blueprint rotates so that the direction of nonzero width becomes horizontal. Here the two
coordinate indices are carried as parameters `i ≠ j` of `not_isPreconnected_compl_of_coord`
instead, and the headline theorem picks whichever pair works. No rotation, no trigonometry and
no coordinate-swap symmetry lemma is needed: every step is symmetric in the two indices except
for which one is named.

The blueprint's opening step — a Jordan curve is not contained in a line — is not needed in
this form. All it is used for is a direction of nonzero width, and that follows from the curve
having two distinct points (`IsJordanCurve.exists_ne`). The degenerate configurations the
blueprint's step rules out are excluded downstream instead, by `C₁ ∩ C₂ = {p₁, p₂}`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.not_isPreconnected_compl_of_coord`,
  `Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.not_isPreconnected_compl`,
  `Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.exists_connectedComponentIn_ne` — `prop:jordan-disconnected`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_unique_unbounded_connectedComponentIn_compl` — the opening sentence of
  the blueprint's Jordan section: the complement of a compact set has exactly one unbounded
  component.
* `Graph.isArcK33_of_pieces` — the packaging of `cor:k33-subdivision` (through
  `Graph.IsArcK33.elim`) that this configuration fits.
* `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.exists_split` — an arc cut at an interior point; the arc analogue
  of the second clause of `lem:jordan-circle`, which `Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.two_arcs` is.

## For the integrator

Three groups of declarations here are general and have no home yet on `main`:

* `Schoenflies.Plane.coord_ext`, `axisVec`, `setCoord`, `coord_eq_of_mem_segment`,
  `le_coord_of_mem_segment`, `coord_le_of_mem_segment` belong beside the coordinate
  half-planes in `Schoenflies/Square.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.exists_split` belongs in `Schoenflies/Subarc.lean`, next to
  `IsArc.exists_isArcBetween_subset`; `Schoenflies.injective_three` is a `Fin 3` triviality.
* `Graph.isArcK33_of_pieces` belongs in `Schoenflies/Graph/K33Planar.lean`, next to
  `Graph.IsArcK33`.

/-- **Nine arcs assembled from three chains, two bridges of a fourth, and a ninth arc.**

This is a packaging lemma: it repackages the `meet` clause of `Graph.IsArcK33` as the five
containment facts that a `K(3,3)` subdivision found inside a plane configuration actually
produces. The rows `0` and `1` of `P` are the two halves of three chains `Ch 0, Ch 1, Ch 2`
running from `x 0` to `x 1`, each cut at the point `y j`; row `2` holds three further pieces,
carried by sets `Sg j`, that all issue from `x 2`.

their geometry is used: only the listed intersections. -/

the blueprint's rotation achieves. `IsJordanCurve.not_isPreconnected_compl` discharges it. -/

is not preconnected.

The direction hypothesis of `not_isPreconnected_compl_of_coord` is discharged here: the curve
has two distinct points, so they differ in one of the two coordinates, and that coordinate
plays the role of the blueprint's horizontal one. No rotation is performed — the proof is run
for whichever coordinate projection has nonzero width, with the two coordinate indices carried
as parameters. -/
