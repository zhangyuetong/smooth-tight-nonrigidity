# The polygonal overlay

Finitely many segments become a plane graph once they are subdivided at their meets and each
duplicated subsegment is named once (`lem:polygonal-overlay`).

## Blueprint

/-! ### Two more properties of `subdivide`

Both belong in `Schoenflies/Subdivide.lean` beside the other four; they are here because that
module is on `main`.

`subdivide_subset` is `subdivide_interior_subset` with the **closed** inclusion carried
alongside the open one, in one existential: separation reads a piece's ends off its source
segment and its interior off the source's interior, and it needs both at the same source.

`subdivide_ends` is the endpoint criterion — an end of a piece that is not a cut point was an
end all along. Without it the case of two pieces from different sources does not close: two
different subpieces can both sit inside one long overlap. -/

/-- Cutting one piece keeps each half inside the whole, closed and open at once. -/

/-! ### What the cut points have to cover

Two conditions, and between them they are the blueprint's "subdivide at all old endpoints,
isolated intersections, and endpoints of overlapping intervals". The second asks for **some**
pair of ends of each meet rather than every pair, because that is what a construction can
supply: a meet is `segment ℝ u v` and `segment ℝ v u` alike, and that a nondegenerate
segment's ends are determined by its point set is a theorem this development does not have and
does not need. -/

/-- Where two pieces meet. -/
def meetOf (P Q : Piece) : Set Plane := P.seg ∩ Q.seg

/-- With the source ends cut too, the endpoint criterion says outright that every end of every
piece of the subdivision is a cut point. -/

/-! ### Producing the cut points

Nothing computes them. The overlay is stated existentially, so the list is built by the
induction that proves it exists, and `segment_inter_segment` hands over the ends of a meet the
moment the meet is known to be nonempty. That is what keeps the choice operator out: the
witnesses of `segment_inter_segment` are not unique, so there is nothing to name. -/

/-! ### Separation

Cut at every end of every source piece and at both ends of every meet, and two pieces of the
subdivision that share an interior point are the **same** segment — equal, not disjoint.
Overlapping collinear pieces cannot be pulled apart by cutting; after enough cuts they
coincide, which is what the blueprint's deduplication clause is for. -/

/-- Collinearity: two pieces of the subdivision that share an interior point lie inside one
nondegenerate segment. If they came from the same source piece, that piece; if from different
ones, the sources' overlap — nondegenerate because the shared point is interior to it, the
overlap's ends being cut points and so interior to nothing. -/
