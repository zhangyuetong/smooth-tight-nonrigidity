# The polygonal overlay, assembled into a plane graph

`Schoenflies/Overlay.lean` does the separating half of `lem:polygonal-overlay`: after cutting
at the right points, two pieces of the subdivision whose interiors meet are the **same
segment**, in one order or the other. This module turns that into a plane graph.

The only thing standing between "the same segment" and "the same edge" is that a segment has
two names, `(a, b)` and `(b, a)`. `orientPiece` removes the choice by fixing a total order on
plane points — `Precedes`, lexicographic in the coordinates — and putting the smaller end
first. Two names for one segment then orient to the *same* name, so "represent each duplicated
subsegment once" stops being deduplication up to reversal and becomes deduplication up to
equality, which `List.dedup` does without knowing any geometry. Nothing geometric rests on
which order it is: only `precedes_total` and `eq_of_precedes_of_precedes` are ever used.

The graph is `overlayGraph`, a `Graph Plane Piece`: its edges are the oriented, deduplicated
pieces, and its vertices are their ends. `IsLink P x y` says that `P` is an edge and that `x`
and `y` are its two ends in one order or the other — which is why
`eq_or_eq_of_isLink_of_isLink` is a two-line case split rather than an argument.

The three clauses of `Graph.IsDrawing` come out as follows.

* *Each edge is drawn by an arc between its ends* — `isArcBetween_segment`, given
  nondegeneracy, which `subdivide_ne` preserves and orienting does not disturb.
* *An edge's arc meets the vertex set only at its own ends* — a vertex is an end of some
  edge, hence a cut point, and `subdivide_avoids` says a cut point is interior to nothing.
* *Distinct edges meet only at shared vertices* — a common point that is an end of neither
  would be interior to both, and `subdivide_separated` would make the two pieces the same
  segment, hence (after orienting) the same name. Once it is an end of one it is a cut point,
  so it cannot be interior to the other either, and it is an end of both.

## Blueprint

* `Precedes`, `orientPiece` — the canonical orientation of a segment.
* `overlayPieces`, `overlayGraph`, `segmentDrawing` — the graph of Lemma 3.7.
* `polygonal_overlay` — Lemma 3.7 (polygonal overlay), the whole statement.
