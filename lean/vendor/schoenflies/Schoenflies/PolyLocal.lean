# Local polygonal connectedness, in the form brick B7 consumes

`Schoenflies/LocallyPolygonal.lean` (brick B5) and `Schoenflies/PolygonalCarrier.lean`
(brick B6) were written independently and each carries its own "joined by a polygonal path
inside a set" relation — `PolyConnIn` as an existential over vertex lists, `PolyReaches` as
an inductive relation — with its own local form. This module makes them one, and then fixes
the shape problem that stops B5 from feeding B7.

## The shape problem

Both local forms ask only that the connecting path lie in `S`:

```
IsLocallyPolyConnAt S p  :  ∃ U open ∋ p, ∀ x y ∈ U ∩ S, PolyConnIn S x y
IsLocallyPolyConnected C :  ∀ w ∈ C, ∃ V open ∋ w, ∀ z ∈ V ∩ C, PolyReaches C w z
```

That is enough for B6 — the clopen argument only needs *some* path — but it is a property
with **no local content whatsoever**: any polygonally connected `S` satisfies it with
`U = univ`. In particular it does not survive intersection with an open set, and that is
exactly what B7 needs: `U_e` is a component of a relatively open piece of `M`, and a
replacement arc has to stay inside the thin tube, not merely inside `M`.

The fix is `IsLocallyPolyConnAt'`: *arbitrarily small* neighbourhoods `U` of `p` such that
any two points of `U ∩ S` are joined **inside `U ∩ S`**. B5's proof already produces this —
its paths are two segments inside convex pieces of the small square about `p`, and the
square's radius may be shrunk freely — so nothing geometric is lost, only misstated.
`isLocallyPolyConn'_compl_openSquare` and `isLocallyPolyConn'_compl_biUnion` are B5 in the
strengthened form, and `IsLocallyPolyConn'.weaken` recovers the original statements.

## Blueprint

Brick B5 ↔ brick B6 of `lem:polygonal-redrawing` (H6), and the interface B7 uses.

* `polyConnIn_iff_polyReaches` — the two relations agree.
* `IsLocallyPolyConn.isLocallyPolyConnected`, `IsLocallyPolyConnected.isLocallyPolyConn` —
  the two weak local forms agree, so B5 as originally stated does feed B6.
* `IsLocallyPolyConnAt'`, `IsLocallyPolyConn'` — the strengthened local form.
* `isLocallyPolyConnAt'_of_convex_cover` — the strengthened star lemma: a square about `p`
  cut by convex pieces, each of which contains `p` as soon as it is nonempty.
* `isLocallyPolyConnAt'_compl_openSquare`, `isLocallyPolyConn'_compl_biUnion` — **brick B5**,
  strengthened.
* `IsLocallyPolyConn'.inter_isOpen` — shrinkability: a relatively open piece of a locally
  polygonally connected set is locally polygonally connected.
* `IsRelOpenIn`, `isRelOpenIn_connectedComponentIn` — components of relatively open subsets
  are relatively open, the fact B7 quotes for `U_e`.
* `polyReaches_of_isPreconnected_of_isRelOpenIn`, `polyReaches_connectedComponentIn` — the
  payoff: two points of a connected relatively open piece are joined *inside that piece*.

/-! ### The strengthened local form -/

/-- `S` is polygonally connected near `p` **inside arbitrarily small neighbourhoods**: for
every open `W` containing `p` there is an open `U ⊆ W` containing `p` such that any two points
of `U ∩ S` are joined by a polygonal path lying in `U ∩ S`.

Two strengthenings over `IsLocallyPolyConnAt`, and both are needed by brick B7. The path is
confined to the neighbourhood, not merely to `S`, because a replacement arc has to stay in its
tube; and the neighbourhoods run through a basis at `p`, because otherwise the property does
not survive intersecting `S` with an open set (`IsLocallyPolyConn'.inter_isOpen`). -/

/-- **The strengthened star lemma**, and the whole geometric content of brick B5's three
shapes. Suppose that inside one square about `p` the trace of `S` is covered by convex sets
`H i`, that each `H i` meets that square only inside `S`, and that each `H i` which meets the
square contains `p`. Then `S` is locally polygonally connected at `p` in the strengthened
sense.

Two points of a small square about `p` are then joined by two segments through `p`, each
inside one convex piece of that *small* square — which is why the path never leaves the
neighbourhood. No piece is required to be nonempty and none is named, so the disk, the
half-disk and the three-quarter disk are all this statement. -/

/-! ### Brick B5, strengthened

The two theorems of `LocallyPolygonal.lean`, reproved in the strengthened form. The geometry
is unchanged — `Plane.exists_radius_sides` still does all the work — because the pieces the
old proof used were already inside the neighbourhood; only the statement moves. -/

/-- **The one-square case of brick B5, strengthened.** The complement of an open axis-parallel
square is polygonally connected near every point of the plane, by paths confined to the
neighbourhood. -/

/-- **Brick B5, strengthened.** The plane minus finitely many open axis-parallel squares whose
closed squares are pairwise disjoint is locally polygonally connected, with the connecting
paths confined to the neighbourhood.

The two cases are unchanged. Away from all the closed squares a small square about `p` lies
inside `M` outright. Otherwise `p` lies in exactly one closed square, and a small enough square
about `p` misses all the others, so near `p` the set `M` *is* the complement of that one open
square — which is what `IsLocallyPolyConnAt'.congr_nhds` says suffices. -/

/-! ### Shrinkability

The point of the strengthening. `IsLocallyPolyConn` does **not** have this property: it holds
for any polygonally connected `S` with `U = univ`, and the comb space — the segments
`{0} × [0,1]`, `{1/n} × [0,1]` and `[0,1] × {0}` — is polygonally connected while its
intersection with a thin open strip about `y = 1` is not locally polygonally connected at
`(0,1)`. -/

/-- **Shrinkability.** A relatively open piece of a locally polygonally connected set is
locally polygonally connected. Taking the neighbourhood inside `W` is what makes this work,
and it is the reason `IsLocallyPolyConnAt'` quantifies over all open `W ∋ p`. -/
