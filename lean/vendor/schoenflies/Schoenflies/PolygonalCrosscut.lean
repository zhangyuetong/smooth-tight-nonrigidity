# Theorem 2.8: two-sided polygonal crosscuts

A crosscut `P` of a simple closed polygon `C` cuts one of the two regions of `ℝ² ∖ C` into
exactly two, bounded by the two curves `Jᵢ = Aᵢ ∪ P`; and `ℝ² ∖ (C ∪ P)` then has exactly three
regions, with boundaries `C, J₁, J₂`.

## One theorem, not two

The blueprint splits the statement into case (a), the crosscut inside `C`, and case (b), the
crosscut outside. The two cases differ only in *which* region of `ℝ² ∖ Jᵢ` is the new cell: in
case (a) it is `Int(Jᵢ)` for both `i`, while in case (b) it is `Ext(J₁)` for one index and
`Int(J₂)` for the other, and which is which is not determined by the data. What *is* uniform is
the description "the region of `ℝ² ∖ Jᵢ` on the far side from a point `y` of the region of
`ℝ² ∖ C` that the crosscut does not enter". So the whole theorem is proved once, for

    farRegion J y  =  the region of `ℝ² ∖ J` that does not contain `y`,

and the two cases of the blueprint are then read off by identifying `farRegion` with `inside`
or with `outside` (`IsSeparating.farRegion_eq_inside`, `…_eq_outside`). A reference point `y`
in the untouched region is the one extra datum this costs, and it is exactly the datum the
blueprint hides in the phrase "let `Ω` be the region containing `P ∖ {p, q}`".

## Exhaustion is pure parity, in both cases at once

Lemma 2.6 (`Schoenflies.crosscut_cells`) already exhibits the two cells as components of
`Ω ∖ P`. All that Theorem 2.8 adds is that there are no others, and the blueprint reads this
off Lemma 2.7. Here the reading is uniform. Write `πJ` for the crossing count of a curve `J`.
For points `x, y` off `J` — Theorem 2.3 —

    `x` and `y` lie in different regions of `ℝ² ∖ J`  ↔  `πJ(x) ≠ πJ(y)`,

which is `ClosedPolygon.parity_ne_iff_mem_farRegion`. Lemma 2.7 gives
`πJ₁ + πJ₂ = πC` at every point, so subtracting the identity at `y` from the identity at `x`
turns "`x` is separated from `y` by `C`" into "`x` is separated from `y` by exactly one of
`J₁, J₂`" — `IsPolygonalCrosscut.separates_xor`, whose entire proof is sixteen cases of `ZMod 2`
arithmetic. No case distinction on inside/outside is made anywhere.

## The hypotheses, bundled

`IsPolygonalCrosscut C J₁ J₂ K a k y` collects the seven hypotheses of the theorem: the two
curves of the split carry the right edges (`Schoenflies.SameEdges`, from Lemma 2.7), the
crosscut meets `C` only in points common to both arcs, and the reference point `y` lies off `C`
in a region the crosscut does not enter. It is closed under swapping the two arcs
(`IsPolygonalCrosscut.symm`), which is why every statement below is proved for index `1` only.

Realizing `J₁` and `J₂` as `ClosedPolygon`s is the consumer's job, exactly as in Lemma 2.7 —
see the note there about the `corner` field. Nothing in this file inspects `corner`.

## Blueprint

* `farRegion`, `IsSeparating.isRegionPair_farRegion`, `IsSeparating.farRegion_eq_inside`,
  `IsSeparating.farRegion_eq_outside` — the blueprint's `Ω`, `Ω†`, `Vᵢ` and `Wᵢ` named as
  functions of a reference point instead of by an existential.
* `ClosedPolygon.arc` — the arcs `A₁, A₂` of Theorem 2.8, as sets; `…vertex_mem_arc`,
  `…vertex_add_mem_arc`, `…endpoints_subset_arc`, `…endpoints_subset_arc'` — the two cut
  vertices lie on both arcs, which is what "the crosscut meets `C` only in its endpoints" has
  to say to be usable.
* `ClosedPolygon.parity_ne_iff_mem_farRegion` — Theorem 2.3 read as a separation criterion.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut` — the hypotheses of Theorem 2.8; `IsPolygonalCrosscut.of_endpoints` is
  the constructor a consumer should use, and `IsPolygonalCrosscut.symm` swaps the two arcs.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.separates_xor` — Lemma 2.7's "consequently", in the uniform form.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.region_eq`, `…cells_disjoint`, `…cells_ne`, `…cell_isComponent₁/₂`,
  `…frontier_cell₁/₂`, `…closure_cell_inter₁/₂` — the two cells of `Ω ∖ P`.
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.inside_diff_eq` — Theorem 2.8(a).
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.outside_diff_eq`, `…inside_exactly_one` — Theorem 2.8(b).
* `IsPolygonalCrosscut.compl_eq`, `…isComponent`, `…near_isComponent`,
  `…cell_isComponent_compl₁/₂`, `…cell_ne_near₁/₂`, `…frontier_near` — "in either case
  `ℝ² ∖ (C ∪ P)` has exactly three regions, with boundaries `C, J₁, J₂`".
* `polygonal_crosscut` — Theorem 2.8, bundled.

/-! ## The region on the far side of a point

The blueprint names the four regions in play — `Ω`, `Ω†`, `Wᵢ`, `Vᵢ` — by their relation to one
another: `Ω†` is the region of `ℝ² ∖ C` the crosscut does not enter, and `Vᵢ` is the region of
`ℝ² ∖ Jᵢ` on the other side of `Jᵢ` from `Ω†`. Fixing a point `y ∈ Ω†` turns all four into
functions of the data. -/

/-- **The setting of Theorem 2.8.** `K` is the edge list of a polygonal crosscut of the polygon

by the crosscut with each of the two arcs; and `y` is a point of the region of `ℝ² ∖ C` that the
crosscut does not enter, which is what fixes which side of `C` the crosscut is on.

The blueprint's "`P` is a simple arc meeting `C` exactly in its two endpoints" appears here in
two pieces: `meets₁` and `meets₂` say that whatever the crosscut has in common with `C` lies on
*both* arcs, which for a genuine crosscut is the two cut vertices (`ClosedPolygon.vertex_mem_arc`,
`ClosedPolygon.vertex_add_mem_arc`); and simplicity is carried by the assumption that `J₁` and
`J₂` really are `ClosedPolygon`s. Nothing else about `K` is assumed — not even that its pieces

/-- **Theorem 2.8 (two-sided polygonal crosscuts).** Let `C` be a simple closed polygon, `K` the
edge list of a polygonal crosscut cutting it at the vertices `a` and `a + k`, and `J₁, J₂` the
two closed polygons formed by the crosscut with the two arcs. Let `y` be a point of the region
of `ℝ² ∖ C` that the crosscut does not enter, and write `Ω = farRegion C.carrier y` for the
other region and `Vᵢ = farRegion Jᵢ.carrier y` for the region of `ℝ² ∖ Jᵢ` on the far side from
`y`. Then

* `Ω ∖ P` is the disjoint union of `V₁` and `V₂`, which are its two connected components;
* their frontiers are `J₁` and `J₂`, and the closure of `Vᵢ` meets `C` exactly in the arc `Aᵢ`;
* `ℝ² ∖ (C ∪ P)` has exactly three regions, `V₁`, `V₂` and the region of `y`.
