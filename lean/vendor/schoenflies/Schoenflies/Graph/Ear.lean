# Ears

The ear decomposition: `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` in both halves, and the step of
`lem:relative-ear` that grows a 2-connected subgraph towards the graph containing it.

## Rerouting is the engine of half (a)

`Graph.Reaches.reroute` says the obvious thing in the one form every consumer wants: if every
edge but `e` survives from `G` into `H`, and whatever `e` joins in `G` is joined in `H` by
other means, then `H` reaches whatever `G` reaches. A walk that took `e` takes the
replacement route instead, and the induction is over the walk.

Its `hends` premise is stated as "**whatever** `e` joins in `G` is joined in `H`", not as "the
two named ends are joined". That is what makes the premise dischargeable in the case where
`e` is not an edge of `G` at all: it is then vacuous. `Graph.Reaches.across_edge_replacement`
is the specialisation the subdivision runs on, and it is where the vacuous case is used — its
`routed` premise carries the three-way choice the blueprint's proof makes in prose:

* reroute along the new path — the deleted vertex is not on it, so the path survives whole;
* reroute around the old graph — the deleted vertex *is* on the path, so the old graph is
  untouched and the replaced edge was not a bridge (`Graph.IsTwoConnected.no_bridge`);
* do not reroute at all — the deleted vertex is an end of the replaced edge, so no surviving
  walk could have taken that edge.

## Half (a) is stated for a path

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.replace_edge_by_path` replaces an edge by a whole path, not by a single
new vertex. Nothing in the argument cares how long the replacement is, and the general form is
what a subdivision needs: subdividing one edge by one vertex is the case where the path has
two edges.

## Half (b) does not need the blueprint's freshness hypothesis

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear` attaches an ear, and the blueprint's "whose internal vertices are
new" is **not** assumed — the proof does not use it. What carries the argument is
`Graph.IsPathGraph.reaches_an_end`: whatever vertex is deleted, every remaining vertex of the
path still reaches one of the two ends. The two ends live in a 2-connected graph, at least one
of them survives the deletion, and that survivor is the hub everything routes through.

Half (a) *does* use freshness, and for a real reason: without it the deleted vertex could sit
both on the replacement path and inside the old graph, and then neither of the two routes
between the replaced edge's ends need exist.

## Finding the ear

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_exists` needs neither the components of `G - V(H)` nor a shortest
path, which is what the blueprint's proof reaches for. The ear is *found*: walk out of the
subgraph to a vertex outside it, take the edge where the walk **first** leaves the subgraph
(`Graph.IsWalk.crossing`), and walk back from that edge's outer end to a *different* vertex of
the subgraph inside `G` minus the edge's inner end — a graph that is connected because `G` is
2-connected, and whose walks therefore never touch the inner end. That walk with the crossing
edge in front is a path of `G` between two vertices of the subgraph, and the crossing edge is
one the subgraph did not have.

`Graph.pathGraphOf` turns it into a graph and `Graph.IsTwoConnected.grows_by_ear` glues it on.
Termination — the blueprint's "finiteness terminates the process" — is not here; this is the
single step, and a consumer that counts edges iterates it.

## Looplessness

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_exists` is the one statement here that has to assume the graph has
no loop, and the hypothesis is not bureaucracy: adding a loop to a 2-connected graph leaves it
2-connected, so a 2-connected subgraph missing only a loop grows by no ear at all, and the
conclusion — a path between *distinct* vertices — is false. It is used only in the degenerate
branch where every vertex is already present and the missing object is an edge. A plane
consumer discharges it from its drawing.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.replace_edge_by_path` — `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (a), "every
  subdivision of `G` is 2-connected", stated for a replacement path of any length.
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear` — `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b), "if `P` is a path whose
  distinct endpoints lie in `G` … then `G ∪ P` is 2-connected".
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_exists`, `Graph.IsTwoConnected.grows_by_ear` — the step of
  `lem:relative-ear`, "`G` is obtained from `H` by repeatedly adding paths whose distinct
  endpoints are already present".
* `Graph.Reaches.reroute`, `Graph.Reaches.across_edge_replacement` — the blueprint's "the
  remaining part of the subdivided edge attaches `w` to `u` or `v`" together with "a
  2-connected graph has no bridge", turned into one transfer lemma.

/-! ### The union of two subgraphs

`Graph.union` and the two inclusions *into* it live in `Schoenflies/Graph/TwoConnected.lean`;
this is the inclusion *out of* it, which the ear construction needs in order to know that the
enlarged subgraph is still a subgraph. It is general and belongs beside the other two — the
integrator should hoist it. -/

/-! ### Rerouting one edge -/

/-- **One edge swapped for any route between its ends.** If every edge of `G` other than `e`
links the same pair in `H`, and whatever `e` links in `G` is joined in `H` by some other
means, then `H` reaches whatever `G` reaches: a walk that took `e` takes the replacement route
instead.

The premise about `e` is universally quantified over its ends rather than stated for a named
pair, so that it is *vacuous* when `e` is not an edge of `G` — which is the case a vertex
deletion produces, and the reason this is the shape that gets used. -/

/-- **The form a subdivision needs.** A walk of `G - c` transfers to any graph holding the
surviving edges, provided the replaced edge's ends are joined there *or* that edge was
incident to the deleted vertex — in which case no walk of `G - c` could have taken it, and the
`hends` premise of `Graph.Reaches.reroute` is vacuous.

That disjunction is the blueprint's three-way case analysis: route along the replacement,
route around the old graph, or do not route at all. -/

/-! ### Attaching an ear -/

/-- **`lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b): attaching an ear preserves 2-connectivity.** `P` is
a path whose two distinct ends lie in the 2-connected graph `G`; then `G ∪ P` is 2-connected.

The blueprint's hypothesis that the ear's internal vertices are new is **not** needed. Delete
a vertex `c`. One of the ear's two ends survives, and it is the hub: `G - c` is connected and
contains it, and every surviving vertex of the ear reaches one of the two ends inside the ear
(`Graph.IsPathGraph.reaches_an_end`) — an end which, having been reached after the deletion, is
itself not `c`, so it lies in `G - c` too. -/

/-! ### Replacing an edge by a path -/

/-- **`lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (a): a subdivision of a 2-connected graph is
2-connected.** Stated for a replacement *path* rather than for a single new vertex, because
nothing in the argument cares how long the replacement is; subdividing one edge by one vertex
is the case where `P` has two edges.

Delete a vertex `c`. One end of the replaced edge survives and is the hub. Everything on the
old side reaches it by `Graph.Reaches.across_edge_replacement`, whose `routed` premise is
discharged by the three-way case analysis: if `c` is an end of the replaced edge there is
nothing to route; if `c` is an old vertex then it is not on the path — this is where the
freshness hypothesis `hnew` is used — and the path itself joins the ends; and if `c` is new
then the old graph is untouched and has no bridge. Everything on the path side reaches an end
of the path, and an end reached after the deletion survived it. -/

/-! ### Finding an ear -/

/-- **A 2-connected subgraph that is not all of a 2-connected graph has an ear.** The ear is
found, not chosen: if the subgraph already has every vertex then a missing edge joins two of
them and is an ear by itself; otherwise a walk out of the subgraph crosses its boundary, and
deleting the crossing edge's inner end leaves `G` connected, so the outer end walks back to a
*different* vertex of the subgraph without passing through the first.

The looplessness hypothesis is used only in the first, degenerate branch, and it cannot be
dropped: a 2-connected graph plus a loop is 2-connected, and no ear is missing from it. -/
