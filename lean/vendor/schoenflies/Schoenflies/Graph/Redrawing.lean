# The polygonal redrawing of a finite plane graph

Bricks B7 and B8 of `lem:polygonal-redrawing`, and the headline theorem: every finite plane
graph is drawn again, on the same abstract graph and the same vertices, with polygonal edges.
Since the vertices of a plane graph *are* plane points and the redrawing leaves them where
they are, the blueprint's "isomorphic plane drawing" is the identity isomorphism, and no
`Graph.IsIsomorphism` is built or needed.

## Three things the design did not have, and this module supplies

**Simple polygonal paths.** `Graph.IsDrawing.edge_param` asks for an *injective*
parametrisation, and brick B6 delivers only a `poly` vertex list, which may cross itself. The
blueprint's Lemma 1.1 makes the path simple "by subdividing at self-intersections and taking a
simple path in the resulting finite graph"; `Schoenflies/PolyPath.lean` deferred that half, and
without it brick B8 cannot discharge the drawing condition at all. `IsArcList` and
`PolyReaches.exists_arcList` supply it, by an induction over the inductive relation rather than
by an overlay graph: at each `step` the new segment is run *backwards* from its far end and
stopped the first time it meets the polygon already built, and the old path is truncated
there. That needs no plane geometry beyond `exists_first_mem_Icc`, and in particular no
connectivity theorem for the overlay graph.

**The contact point is on the frame.** `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_core` states that the core meets
the square about a vertex in exactly one point, but not that this point is on the square's
boundary — and if it were interior the core would not lie in the plane minus the open squares,
which is the carrier brick B5 speaks about, nor would the radial segment from the vertex reach
it. `Plane.supDist_eq_of_inter_eq_singleton` closes the gap by connectedness: an interior
contact point would make the core's trace on the square a nonempty proper clopen piece.

**Radial arithmetic.** That two radials of one square meet only at the centre, and that a
radial meets the plane minus the open squares only at its far end, are both the statement that
the sup distance to the centre is a faithful coordinate along a radius
(`Plane.supDist_lt_of_mem_segment`, `Plane.radial_meet`). These are the "distinct radials in
one square meet only at `v`" and "radials meet the replacement paths only at the designated
boundary points" of brick B8's design, and neither is free.

## Blueprint

Bricks B7 and B8 of `lem:polygonal-redrawing` (H6), and the lemma itself.

* `Plane.supNorm_smul`, `Plane.supDist_add_smul`, `Plane.supDist_lt_of_mem_segment`,
  `Plane.segment_subset_closedSquare`, `Plane.radial_meet` — the radial segments of brick B8.
* `Plane.supDist_eq_of_inter_eq_singleton` — a core's contact point lies on the frame of its
  square; the missing clause of brick B4.
* `lastP`, `poly_snoc`, `IsArcList` — a **simple** polygonal path, in the `u :: t`
  presentation that keeps every statement free of dependent nonemptiness proofs.
* `isArcBetween_poly` — the carrier of a simple polygonal path is an arc between its ends.
* `IsArcList.truncate`, `IsArcList.snoc` — cutting one at any of its points, and extending one
  by a segment that touches it only at its last vertex.
* `PolyReaches.exists_arcList` — **every polygonal path contains a simple one**; the deferred
  half of Lemma 1.1.
* `Graph.polygonal_redrawing` — `lem:polygonal-redrawing`, with bricks B7 and B8 inside its
  proof: the `ε` making the tubes about the cores pairwise disjoint, the component `U e` of
  the core inside its tube, and the assembly of radial, replacement path and radial.

/-! ### Radial segments in a square

A segment from the centre of a square to a point of its boundary frame leaves the open square
only at its far end, and two such segments in one square meet only at the centre. Those two
facts are the whole of the "radials" half of brick B8, and both are statements about the sup
distance scaling along a segment. -/

/-! ### Simple polygonal paths

`poly vs` is the carrier of a vertex list, and a general vertex list crosses itself. The
drawing condition of a plane graph asks for an *injective* parametrisation, so what brick B8
needs is a vertex list whose carrier is an **arc**. `IsArcList` is exactly the condition that
makes the concatenation of `Schoenflies/Concatenate.lean` apply at every step: consecutive
vertices differ, and each segment meets the rest of the polygon only at the vertex they
share.

The work of this section is `PolyReaches.exists_arcList`: *any* polygonal path inside a set
contains a simple one with the same ends. That is the half of the blueprint's Lemma 1.1 which
`Schoenflies/PolyPath.lean` deferred, and without it nothing downstream can discharge
`Graph.IsDrawing`. The induction is over the inductive relation `PolyReaches`, and the step
takes the *first* point at which the new segment, run backwards from its far end, meets the
polygon already built, truncates there and appends. -/

namespace Graph

/-- **The polygonal redrawing of a finite plane graph** (`lem:polygonal-redrawing`). A finite
plane graph is drawn again, on the *same* abstract graph and the *same* vertices, with every
edge a polygonal arc. The blueprint speaks of an isomorphic plane drawing; since the vertices
of a plane graph are plane points and the redrawing leaves them where they are, the
isomorphism is the identity and no `Graph.IsIsomorphism` appears.

The construction, in the order the proof takes it.

* **The squares** (brick B2). One radius `r` serves every vertex: the square about a vertex
  meets no other vertex, meets no arc of an edge it is not incident with, and distinct squares
  are disjoint.
* **The cores** (brick B4). Each edge's arc, cut back to what lies between its last exit from
  the square at one end and its first entry into the square at the other. A core carries no
  vertex, so distinct cores are disjoint; and — `Plane.supDist_eq_of_inter_eq_singleton` — its
  two contact points sit on the *frames* of the two squares, so the core lies in the plane `M`
  minus the open squares.
* **The tubes** (brick B7). One `ε` makes the `ε`-tubes about the cores pairwise disjoint, by
  compact separation and the single-bound lemma. `U e` is the connected component, inside
  `M ∩ tube e`, of the core; it is relatively open in `M`, so the strengthened brick B5 joins
  the two contact points by a polygonal path *inside* `U e`.
* **The assembly** (brick B8). The path is straightened to a simple one
  (`Schoenflies.PolyReaches.exists_arcList`), then a radial segment is prepended at each end.
  A radial meets `M` only at its far end and two radials meet only at their common centre, so
  the three pieces glue to an arc; `Schoenflies.isArcBetween_poly` produces the
  parametrisation that `IsDrawing.edge_param` demands. -/
