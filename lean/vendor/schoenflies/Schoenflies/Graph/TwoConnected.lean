# Vertex deletion and 2-connectivity

Deleting a vertex from Mathlib's multigraph `Graph α β`, and the blueprint's notion of a
2-connected graph.

## Vertex deletion is Mathlib's

Mathlib already has it: `Graph.deleteVerts G X = G.induce (V(G) \ X)`, in
`Mathlib/Combinatorics/Graph/Delete.lean`, with `V(G.deleteVerts X) = V(G) \ X` and
`E(G.deleteVerts X) = {e | ∃ x y, G.IsLink e x y ∧ x ∉ X ∧ y ∉ X}` — an edge with an end in
`X` is gone, which is exactly what is wanted. Nothing here redefines it; `G.deleteVerts {x}`
is the deletion of one vertex, and what this file adds is the transfer of *walks* across it,
which Mathlib has no notion of.

Two of those transfers are the whole story, and both are corollaries of `Graph.IsWalk.anti`:

* `Graph.IsWalk.deleteVerts_singleton` — a walk that never visits `x` is a walk of `G - x`.
  The edges of such a walk automatically survive, because the ends of an edge of a walk are
  vertices the walk visits.
* `Graph.IsWalk.notMem_of_inc_of_deleteVerts` — a walk **in** `G - x` cannot have used an
  edge at `x`; there are none left to use. This is how an argument that routes around a
  vertex ends up avoiding a named edge, and it is what makes `Graph.IsTwoConnected.no_bridge`
  short.

Deleting a vertex the graph does not have changes nothing — `G.deleteVerts {x} = G` on the
nose (`Graph.deleteVerts_singleton_eq_self`), since `V(G) \ {x} = V(G)`. That equation is
what makes the union lemma's hard case disappear.

## At least three vertices

The counting clause of 2-connectivity is carried by `Graph.HasThreeVertices`, "three pairwise
distinct vertices", rather than by `3 ≤ V(G).ncard`. The two agree on a finite graph, but the
existential form is **monotone with no finiteness hypothesis** (`Graph.HasThreeVertices.mono`),
and monotonicity is precisely what `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union` needs: the union of two graphs
is not known to be finite at the point where its third vertex is produced. `Set.ncard` is `0`
on an infinite set, so `3 ≤ V(G).ncard` would additionally make every infinite graph fail to
be 2-connected, which is not the intent of the convention.

What consumers actually use is never the clause itself but `Graph.HasThreeVertices.exists_ne_ne`
— any two vertices leave a third over. `Graph.hasThreeVertices_iff_ncard` is the bridge back to
the count, for a consumer that has one.

## The convention, verbatim, and what it costs

`Graph.IsTwoConnected` is the blueprint's definition word for word (§"Plane graphs and the
utility graph"): at least three vertices, connected, and still connected after any one vertex
is deleted. Two consequences the blueprint calls out are recorded here as theorems rather
than as prose:

* the one-edge graph is **not** 2-connected, and
* a two-vertex cycle — two parallel edges — is a cycle without being 2-connected.

Both are instances of `Graph.not_isTwoConnected_banana`: `Graph.banana u v F` has only the two
vertices `u` and `v` whatever `F` is, so it fails the counting clause. Two-vertex cycles do
occur in the development, as face boundaries inside a larger 2-connected graph, and this is
the theorem that says they are not themselves 2-connected. (No cycle is *named* here: this
file must not depend on the cycle module.)

## Union

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Combinatorics/Graph/Lattice.lean` provides only the *infimum* of two
graphs — there is no union in this version of Mathlib — so `Graph.union` is defined here. On
an edge belonging to both graphs, `G`'s ends win:

```
(G.union H).IsLink e x y ↔ G.IsLink e x y ∨ (e ∉ E(G) ∧ H.IsLink e x y)
```

which makes the definition total. It has to be resolved somehow: two graphs may disagree
about the ends of a shared edge name, and then no graph has both as subgraphs. When the two
graphs are `Graph.Compatible` — in particular when both are subgraphs of one graph, via
`Graph.Compatible.of_le_le`, which is the only way the plane layer forms unions — the
disjunction collapses to the naive one (`Graph.Compatible.union_isLink`) and both graphs are
subgraphs of the union.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsTwoConnected` — the definition in §"Plane graphs and the utility graph": "a finite
  graph is *2-connected* if it has at least three vertices, is connected, and remains
  connected after deletion of any one vertex".
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.no_cut_vertex` — "with this convention a 2-connected graph has no cut
  vertex".
* `Graph.not_isTwoConnected_banana` — "the one-edge graph is not 2-connected", and the same
  computation for the two-vertex cycle of the next paragraph.
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.no_bridge` — "A 2-connected graph has no bridge", the step of
  `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (a) that the ear decomposition runs on. Stated as "deleting
  the edge leaves its ends connected", which is the form `lem:cycle-criterion` consumes; the
  cycle itself is built elsewhere.
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union` — `lem:union-two-connected`, "if two finite 2-connected graphs
  have at least two vertices in common, their union is 2-connected".

connected" — the hypothesis of the cycle criterion.

The blueprint's proof names the two components of `G - e` and finds a vertex of one of them
other than its endpoint. This proof routes around instead, and never mentions a component: a
third vertex `w` exists; the graph without `v` still joins `u` to `w`, and the graph without
`u` still joins `w` to `v`; and a walk that survives a vertex deletion cannot have used an
edge there, so neither walk used `e`. A loop needs no argument at all. -/
