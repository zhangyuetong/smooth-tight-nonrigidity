# The realisation of a cycle is a Jordan curve

A cycle of a plane graph arrives as `Schoenflies/Graph/Cycle.lean` presents it: an edge, and a
path between that edge's two ends which does not use it. Its realisation is the set of points
the arcs of those edges occupy, and the claim is that this set is a Jordan curve.

## The argument is set-level; no parametrisation of a walk is built

The obvious approach — a `walkArc` definition folding `Schoenflies.concatenate` along the edge
list — is the wrong shape twice over. The empty-list base case is a *constant* map, which is
not an arc, so the fold cannot be shown injective at the last step; and threading a
parametrisation through the induction buys nothing, since every consumer wants the point set.

Instead **the existence of the arc is what the induction carries**, in
`Schoenflies.IsArcBetween`. The arcs are chosen inside the induction and the concatenation of
them is chosen by the gluing theorem; no parametrisation is ever named.

## Where the geometry enters

Exactly once, in `Graph.IsDrawing.first_edge_meets_rest`: a common point of the first edge's
arc and the rest of the path is a vertex incident with both edges
(`Graph.IsDrawing.arcs_meet_at_vertex`), hence one of the two ends of the first edge, and the
path's own freshness clause — the vertex a step departs from is not one the rest visits —
forbids it being the source. Taking the same edge again is refused by the *same* clause, so a
separate "the edges of a path are distinct" lemma is not needed.

## Loops

Nothing here hypothesises looplessness, and nothing needs to: `Graph.IsDrawing.ne_of_isLink`
derives it. An edge with equal ends would be drawn by an arc whose parametrisation takes the
same value at `0` and at `1`, which its injectivity forbids. That is what rules out the
degenerate cycle `Graph.liesOnCycle_of_isLoopAt` — a loop with an empty detour — whose
realisation is a single arc and not a Jordan curve.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.edgesCover` — what a *list* of edges occupies. `Graph.pointSet` is the vertices
  together with this, taken over all the edges of the graph.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.path_isArcBetween` — the realisation of a path is an arc between its two
  ends.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isJordanCurve` — §"Plane graphs and the utility graph": "in a plane
  graph the realization of a cycle is a Jordan curve: its edges are simple arcs with pairwise
  disjoint interiors, and consecutive edges meet exactly at their shared vertices, so the edge
  arcs concatenate injectively into a simple closed curve".
* `Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_inter` — the meeting condition in full: the detour and the edge meet
  in exactly the edge's two ends. `Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.of_two_arcs` consumes only one
  inclusion of it, but the equality is what the blueprint asserts.

The induction carries the *existence* of an arc, not a parametrisation. Its one geometric
step is `Graph.IsDrawing.first_edge_meets_rest`. -/

/-- **The first edge's arc meets the rest of the path only at the waypoint.** Two cases, and
neither is geometric beyond the workhorse `Graph.IsDrawing.arcs_meet_at_vertex`: if the rest
takes the same edge again, the source is one of its ends; if it takes a different one, a
common point is a vertex incident with both, so it is the source or the waypoint. Either way a
point that was the source would put the source among the vertices the rest visits, which is
what the path's freshness clause forbids. -/

/-- **The realisation of a path is an arc between its two ends.** The path must go somewhere:
the empty path draws the empty set, which is not an arc.

The induction is on the path, at the source end, and what it carries is the existence of the
arc. At each step the first edge's arc and the rest's arc meet only at the waypoint
(`Graph.IsDrawing.first_edge_meets_rest`), so `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.concatenate` glues
them. -/
