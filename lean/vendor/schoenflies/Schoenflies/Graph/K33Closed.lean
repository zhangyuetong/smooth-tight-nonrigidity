# Discharging the realization hypothesis of `lem:k33`

`Schoenflies/Graph/K33Planar.lean` proves the nonplanarity of `K(3,3)` from one assumption,
`Graph.IsHexRealization`: that the six-cycle, the two arcs the chord cuts it into, and the two
closed curves the chord forms with them are all presented by cyclic vertex lists.
`Schoenflies/Realization.lean` now supplies the presentations. This module wires the two
together.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.exists_poly_anchored`, `Schoenflies.IsPolygonal.union`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.isPolygonal_edgesCover` — §1: a polygonal set is the carrier of a vertex list
  running between any two of its points, so two polygonal sets that meet have a polygonal union,
  and a walk of a polygonal plane graph draws a polygonal set.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.reverse` — a closed polygon read backwards.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.arc_vertex_eq`, `…arcPieces_eq` — **the decomposition of an arc is
  the arc's own**: two closed polygons that share an arc, starting at the same vertex, run
  through the same vertices along it. This is what makes the three presentations below fit
  together into one crosscut.
* `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs_oriented` — the realization of a splitting with the
  first arc's *direction* fixed as well, so that two realizations of one arc can be compared.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.isPolygonal_hexSet`, `…chord_inter_arcA`, `…chord_inter_arcB` — the three
  curves the crosscut is built from, as polygonal Jordan curves.
* `Graph.IsHexGeneric` — the general-position hypothesis that survives: at each of the two cut
  points, the six-cycle and both spliced curves turn.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.isHexRealization` — `Graph.IsHexRealization`, discharged from it. **This is
  the theorem this module exists for.**
* `Graph.Bendable`, `Graph.IsK33Config.false_of_hexGeneric`, `…not_isDrawing_of_bendable`,
  `Graph.IsArcK33.false_of_bendable`, `Graph.IsK33Subdivision.false_of_bendable`,
  `Graph.k33Graph_not_isDrawing` — `lem:k33` and `cor:k33-subdivision` with `IsHexRealization`
  replaced by `IsHexGeneric`.

## What is still assumed, and why — READ THIS BEFORE USING THE THEOREMS BELOW

**Milestone H8 is not closed here.** `Graph.IsHexRealization` is gone, but a strictly smaller
hypothesis has taken its place, and it is not discharged.

`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` forbids a vertex at which the curve runs straight through, and
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` says that this is not a defect of the proofs:
*every* vertex of *every* realization is a corner of the curve. A crosscut whose ends are cut
points of `C` therefore forces those ends to be corners — of `C`, and of both curves the
crosscut forms with the two arcs. `Graph.IsHexGeneric` says exactly that and nothing more, and
by the two corner theorems it cannot be weakened while the crosscut is presented as a
`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut`.

For a drawn `K(3,3)` it is the statement that at each of the six vertices the three edges leave
along three pairwise non-collinear germs. A polygonal drawing need not have that: two of the
three edges at a vertex may leave along exactly opposite rays, which is perfectly compatible
with the drawing condition. The remaining gap is therefore a *bending* lemma — every polygonal
drawing can be redrawn so that no two edges at a vertex are collinear there — and it is
genuinely about changing the drawing, not about presentations. `Graph.Bendable` is that
statement in the shape the theorems below consume; nothing here proves it.

/-! ## A polygonal set is a vertex list between any two of its points

`Schoenflies.IsPolygonal` is "the carrier of a vertex list", and a vertex list carries a *path*,
so the predicate is not closed under arbitrary finite unions — two disjoint segments are not the
carrier of any one list. It is closed under unions that meet, and the way to see that is to move
the ends of the list: a list can be made to start and end wherever one likes on its own carrier,
by running out and back. -/

/-! ## A closed polygon read backwards

A realization of a splitting names its two arcs *in a direction*, and two realizations of one
arc need not agree on it. Reversing the cyclic order is what reconciles them. -/

/-! ## The decomposition of an arc is the arc's own

`Graph.IsHexRealization` asks for three closed polygons that agree on the arcs they share. They
are found independently, and nothing so far says they agree — until this: two closed polygons
carrying the same arc, and starting it at the same vertex, run through the same vertices along
it. The proof walks the arc: the first edges of the two are two segments leaving one point along
one ray, so one contains the other, and the shorter one's far end would be a vertex of its own
polygon interior to an edge of the other — which `corner` forbids. -/

ends `x s` and `y (s + 1)` of the remaining edge, the six-cycle turns, and so does each of the two
closed curves the remaining edge forms with the two halves of the six-cycle.

This is not a hypothesis chosen for convenience. `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` and
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.exists_vertex_eq_of_isCornerAt` together say that the vertex set of a
realization *is* the corner set of the curve; a crosscut cutting `C` at these two points forces
them to be vertices of all three closed polygons, hence corners of all three curves. For a drawn
`K(3,3)` it says that at each of the six vertices no two of the three edges leave along one

forms with its halves are three polygonal Jordan curves, so
`Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs_oriented` presents each of them as a closed polygon whose
two arcs are the two given halves, both read from `x s` to `y (s+1)`.

The three presentations are found independently, and what makes them fit together is
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.arcPieces_eq`: two closed polygons carrying one arc from one vertex cut
it into the same edges. So the six-cycle's presentation and the first spliced curve's agree on the
first half, the six-cycle's and the second spliced curve's agree on the second half, and the two
spliced curves agree on the remaining edge — the last only after reversing one of them, since a
crosscut is traversed one way in each of the two curves it bounds. -/
