# Plane graphs

There is no `PlaneGraph` type. A plane graph is an abstract `G : Graph Plane β` **together
with** a drawing `drawing : β → ℝ → Plane`, related by `IsDrawing G drawing`. The abstract
graph stays itself, so every combinatorial theorem of `Schoenflies/Graph/` applies with
nothing to project through, and "a plane graph realises an abstract finite graph" is true by
construction rather than by a theorem. Bundling would put a record projection inside every
combinatorial citation.

The vertices being plane points is what makes the definition short: that the vertices are
distinct is not a clause, it is what `V(G) : Set Plane` already means.

`IsDrawing` has three clauses. Each edge is drawn by an injective continuous parametrization on
`[0, 1]` whose endpoint values are the two ends of that edge; an edge's arc meets the vertex set
only at those two ends; and two distinct edges meet only at vertices incident with both. The
second and third are the blueprint's "distinct edges of a plane graph meet only at shared
vertices", split so that `unique_edge_at` — away from the vertices a point of the drawing lies
on exactly one edge — falls out directly. That corollary is the form the polygonal overlay
wants.

The first clause names the *parametrization*, not merely its image. The weaker reading — "the
point set of an edge is an arc between its ends" — suffices for everything about faces, and
fails for the polygonal redrawing, which must speak of the last parameter at which an edge is
inside a given square. `edge_isArcBetween` recovers the weaker reading, so consumers needing
only that are unaffected.

## Blueprint

* `IsDrawing` — a plane graph, as an abstract graph plus a drawing.
* `IsDrawing.edge_param`, `IsDrawing.edge_isArcBetween` — the parametrization, and its image.
* `IsDrawing.arcs_meet_at_vertex`, `IsDrawing.unique_edge_at` — distinct edges meet only at
  shared vertices; away from the vertices, a point lies on exactly one edge.
* `pointSet`, `IsDrawing.isCompact_pointSet`, `exterior`, `isOpen_exterior` — what a plane
  graph occupies, and the open set its faces live in.
* `face` — the component of the exterior through a point off the drawing. Named by a point
  rather than indexed, so no face has to be produced before it is spoken about.

  This says more than "the point set `edgeArc drawing e` is an arc between the ends". That
  weaker clause makes two drawings with the same point sets indistinguishable, which is fine
  for the face theory and useless for the redrawing argument: "the last parameter at which
  this edge is inside the square at `v`" is meaningless unless `drawing e` is itself the
  parametrization. `edge_isArcBetween` below recovers the weaker statement.

  Stated orientation-free — `G.IsLink e (drawing e 0) (drawing e 1)` — because `IsLink` is
  symmetric, so pinning `drawing e 0` to a *named* end of a *given* link would force the two
  ends to coincide. -/
