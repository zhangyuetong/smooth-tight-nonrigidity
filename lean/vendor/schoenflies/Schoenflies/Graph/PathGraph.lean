# A path presented as a graph

`Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean` says what it means for an edge list to *run* through a graph.
This file says what it means for a graph to *be* a path, and — the point of the file —
constructs one.

## Why the object exists

An ear is a path that gets glued onto a graph, so it has to be a graph itself, not a walk
inside one. `Graph.IsPathGraph P u W v` says that `P`'s own edges, listed in the order `W`,
form a path from `u` to `v` and that `P`'s vertices are exactly the ones that path visits.
The list `W` is an index of the predicate rather than an existential: its **order** is part
of the claim, and it is what lets every later argument cut the path at a vertex without first
having to sort anything.

Mathlib's `Graph α β` carries a `Set β` of edges, not a list, so the correspondence between
the two is a clause of the definition (`Graph.IsPathGraph.edgeSet_eq`) rather than something
a list-based graph would give for free.

## Constructing one

`Graph.pathGraphOf G u W` is the subgraph of `G` spanned by the walk `W` from `u`: the
vertices the walk visits, and its own edges. Everything else in the file is a hypothesis of
the form `IsPathGraph`; this is where one is produced, and it is what an ear decomposition
runs on — a path found inside a big graph has to be turned into a graph before it can be
unioned back in.

## What the ear argument actually asks

Always the same thing: **whatever vertex is deleted, every remaining vertex of the path still
reaches one of the two ends** (`Graph.IsPathGraph.reaches_an_end`). The proof is uniform in
the deleted vertex `c`, with no case split on whether `c` is an end, an interior vertex or
off the path at all:

* if `c` is on the path, cut there (`Graph.IsPath.split`); each remaining vertex lies on one
  of the two halves, and a half runs to its far end without meeting the cut, because the
  split's last clause says the far half never returns to the source;
* if `c` is not on the path, cut at the vertex itself and reverse the near half.

Both branches go through the same two lemmas, `Graph.IsPath.reaches_target_of_ne_source` and
its mirror, so the interior case has no separate content.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsPathGraph` — the object called "a path `P`" in Lemma
  `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b) ("if `P` is a path whose distinct endpoints lie in `G`
  … then `G ∪ P` is 2-connected") and "an ear" in Lemma `lem:relative-ear`.
* `Graph.IsPathGraph.reaches_an_end` — the blueprint's "every component of `P - x` is
  attached to `G - x` at one of the two endpoints of `P`; when `x` is an endpoint, the
  remainder of `P` is attached at the other endpoint", both sentences at once.
* `Graph.pathGraphOf` — the "shortest path through `L` between two such neighbors is an ear"
  of `lem:relative-ear`: a path of the ambient graph, presented as a graph.

Nothing here mentions 2-connectivity; the union of a 2-connected graph with an ear is a
later module.

## Namespace

Root `Graph`, as fixed by `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean`, so that `h.reaches_an_end` and
`G.pathGraphOf u W` resolve by dot notation.

edges are exactly the entries of `W`, and its vertices are exactly the ones that path visits.

that deletes a vertex cuts `W` in two, and a graph whose edges were only a set would have to
recover the order first. -/
