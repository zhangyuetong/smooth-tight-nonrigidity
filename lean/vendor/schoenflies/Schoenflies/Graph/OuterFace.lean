# The outer face

Exactly one face of a finite plane graph is unbounded.

The plane fact this needs is not "the exterior of a large disk is connected" but the exterior
of a *square*, and that one is elementary — `Plane.isConnected_beyondSquare`, four convex
half-planes with consecutive ones sharing a corner. The disk version is what would have
needed a traversal of the circle, which a trigonometry-free development withholds.

No face is produced as data: a face is named by a point of it, as `Graph.face` always has
been, so "the outer face" is "the face through any point far enough out".

## Blueprint

* `exists_unbounded_face` — some face is unbounded.
* `unbounded_face_unique` — any two unbounded faces coincide.
* `beyondSquare_subset_face` — an unbounded face swallows the whole outside of any square
  containing the drawing. This is the working form: it is how one proves a given point lies in
  the outer face.
