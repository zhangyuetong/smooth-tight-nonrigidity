# Lemma 3.10: the utility graph is not planar, and Corollary 3.11 for its subdivisions

`Schoenflies/Graph/K33.lean` built the whole configuration: the six-cycle of a drawn `K(3,3)`
is a Jordan curve, each of the three remaining edges is a crosscut of it, two of the three lie
on the same side, their endpoints alternate, and any two of them are disjoint. This module
wires those five facts to `Schoenflies.alternating_crosscuts` and derives the contradiction; it
then does the blueprint's reduction of `cor:k33-subdivision` to `lem:k33`.

**One hypothesis is assumed and not proved: `Graph.IsHexRealization`. See "The gap" below.**
The remaining results use only the hypotheses in their statements.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsHexCrosscut` — the six-cycle, together with one of the three remaining edges, in the
  vocabulary `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut` speaks: a `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon`, its two
  arcs, the crosscut, and a reference point.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.endpoints_subset_arcA`, `…_arcB`, `…exists_reference_point`,
  `…isHexCrosscut` — the four *topological* clauses of `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut`,
  discharged from the drawing, so that only the combinatorial realization has to be assumed.
* `Graph.IsHexRealization` — that combinatorial realization, and the one thing assumed here.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.exists_two_chords_same_region` — `lem:k33`, "two of the three lie on the
  same side", with the side named as a region of the complement rather than as one of a pair
  of open sets, which is the form the crosscut corollary consumes.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.false_of_isHexCrosscut` — the contradiction at a *fixed* pair of remaining
  edges: `cor:alternating-crosscuts` makes them meet, `chords_disjoint` says they do not.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.false_of_hexCrosscuts`, `…false_of_hexRealizations` — `lem:k33` for a
  drawing that is already polygonal.
* `Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing` — `lem:k33`: a graph carrying a copy of `K(3,3)` has no
  plane drawing at all. `lem:polygonal-redrawing` reduces the general drawing to a polygonal
  one, which is the only place polygonality is used.
* `Graph.IsArcK33`, `Graph.k33Graph`, `Graph.IsArcK33.arcDrawing`, `…isDrawing`,
  `…isK33Config`, `…false_of_realization` — `cor:k33-subdivision`, first half: nine arcs in the
  plane meeting only where a `K(3,3)` forces them to already *are* a plane drawing of `K(3,3)`,
  on an abstract graph built here for the purpose.
* `Graph.IsK33Subdivision`, `…isArcK33`, `…false_of_realization` — `cor:k33-subdivision`: in a
  plane drawing of a subdivision, the branch paths draw nine such arcs.

## The gap: realizing the six-cycle as a `ClosedPolygon`

Every statement of `Schoenflies/PolygonalJordan.lean`, `Schoenflies/PolygonalCrosscut.lean` and
`Schoenflies/AlternatingCrosscuts.lean` is about a `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon m` — a cyclic
*vertex list* with `vertex_inj`, `edges_meet` and `corner`. The six-cycle of a polygonally
drawn `K(3,3)` is a polygonal Jordan curve as a **point set**, and nothing in the development
turns a point set into a `ClosedPolygon`: there is no declaration anywhere whose conclusion is
`∃ m (C : ClosedPolygon m), C.carrier = _`. The only closed polygons that exist are the
hand-built `Schoenflies.triangle` and `Schoenflies.unitTriangle`.

`IsHexRealization` is exactly that missing step, stated for the one curve this argument needs
it for and pared down to its combinatorial core: four closed polygons and four equations
identifying their carriers and edge lists with the drawing. No topological side condition
survives in it — the reference point of Theorem 2.8 and the three "meets" clauses are proved
here from the drawing. It is *not proved here*, and every theorem below that mentions it is
therefore requires that realization as a hypothesis.

**Why the realization is allowed to change the drawing.** `IsHexRealization` asks for
`C.arc a k = arcA e s`, which pins the two ends of that arc — the vertices `x s` and
`y (s+1)` — to be *vertices* of `C`. A `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` has no straight vertices
(its `corner` field), so this is possible only if the six-cycle actually turns at `x s` and at
`y (s+1)`. A polygonal drawing need not do that: two of the three polygonal edges at a vertex
may leave it in exactly opposite directions, and then no closed polygon with that carrier has
that point as a vertex. A realization must therefore be free to bend the drawing at the six
vertices first, and `Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing` gives it that freedom: it hands the
realization a polygonal drawing and accepts *any* drawing back. This restriction comes from
`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut`, not from anything here; the alternative is a crosscut
interface that lets the two cut points be interior to edges of `C`.

/-! ### The missing realization, isolated

The six-cycle of a polygonally drawn `K(3,3)`, cut by the remaining edge `e s (s+1)`, presented
in the vocabulary of `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut`: a `ClosedPolygon` whose carrier is the
six-cycle, whose two arcs from the cut are the two halves `arcA e s` and `arcB e s`, and whose
crosscut occupies exactly the remaining edge's arc. -/

/-- **The six-cycle and one remaining edge, realized as a polygonal crosscut.** `C` is the
six-cycle as a `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon`, cut at the vertices `a` and `a + k` — which are the
two ends `x s` and `y (s+1)` of the remaining edge indexed by `s` — into the two arcs
`arcA e s` and `arcB e s`; `K` is the remaining edge, and `J₁`, `J₂` the two closed polygons it
forms with the two arcs.

This is the *only* thing the argument below assumes, and it is exactly what a bridge from
polygonal Jordan curves to `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` would supply. -/

/-! ### The topological side conditions of the crosscut, discharged

`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut` asks for four things beyond the edge lists: that the crosscut
meets the polygon only in points of each arc, and a reference point off the polygon in the
region the crosscut does not enter. All four are properties of the *drawing*, and are proved
here, so that what has to be assumed from outside is only the combinatorial realization
(`Graph.IsHexRealization`). -/

/-! ### What must still be assumed: the combinatorial realization

Everything above is proved. What is not is that the six-cycle, its two arcs, and the two closed
curves the remaining edge forms with them are *closed polygons at all* — that a polygonal Jordan
curve given as a point set carries a cyclic vertex list. `IsHexRealization` says exactly that,
and nothing more: no reference point, no meeting condition, only the four `ClosedPolygon`s and
the four equations identifying their carriers and edge lists with the drawing. -/

/-- **The six-cycle and one remaining edge, realized combinatorially.** The six-cycle is a
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` `C` whose two arcs from the cut at `a`, `a + k` are the two halves
`arcA e s`, `arcB e s` of the six-cycle; the remaining edge occupies the segments `K`; and the
two closed curves it forms with the two arcs are closed polygons `J₁`, `J₂` carrying exactly
those segments.

This is the one thing this module assumes and does not prove. See "The gap" in the module
docstring. -/

point is `exists_reference_point`. -/

none (`chords_disjoint`). -/

/-! ## Corollary 3.11: no subdivision of `K(3,3)` has a plane drawing

The blueprint's proof replaces each branch path of a subdivision by the simple arc it draws and
then treats that arc as a single edge. Both halves are done here, in that order: first the
*abstract* statement that nine arcs meeting only where they must already carry a drawn
`K(3,3)` (`Graph.IsArcK33`), then the reduction of a drawn subdivision to nine such arcs. -/

/-- **Nine arcs in the plane, meeting only where they must.** This is what a plane drawing of a
subdivision of `K(3,3)` leaves once each branch path has been replaced by the arc it draws: six
distinct points, and for each pair `(i, j)` an arc from `x i` to `y j`, with two distinct arcs
meeting only in a point that is an endpoint of both.

Nothing here mentions a graph. The abstract `K(3,3)` that carries these arcs is built below. -/
