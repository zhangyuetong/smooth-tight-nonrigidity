# Components and shortest paths

The two prerequisites of the relative ear decomposition (`lem:relative-ear`) that no earlier
module builds: the **component** of a vertex, and a **shortest** walk between two vertices.
Both are then spent on the geometric heart of that lemma — a component of `G - S` has two
distinct neighbours in `S`, and a path between two of them whose interior lies outside `S`.

## The component is a comprehension

`G.component u = {v | G.Reaches u v}`, exactly as `connectedComponentIn` collects the points
a space reaches. Nothing restricts the comprehension to `V(G)`: the empty walk already demands
a vertex of the graph (`Graph.IsWalk.nil`), so `G.Reaches u v` carries `v ∈ V(G)` with it, and
a clause `v ∈ V(G) ∧ …` would be redundant noise at every use site. When `u ∉ V(G)` the
component is empty, which is the convention that makes the covering statement
`Graph.iUnion_component` true with no side condition.

Reachability is an equivalence relation on `V(G)`, so the component is closed under `Reaches`,
two components are equal or disjoint, and the components cover `V(G)`. The one statement that
is not pure equivalence-relation bookkeeping is that the **induced** subgraph on a component
is connected: a walk between two vertices of a component never leaves it
(`Graph.IsWalk.walkVertices_subset_component`), so it is already a walk of the induced
subgraph, by `Graph.IsWalk.anti`.

## Shortest walks need no finiteness

The set of lengths of walks from `u` to `v` is a nonempty set of naturals, so it has a least
element — `Nat.find`, with no `Graph.Finite` hypothesis anywhere. That is worth noticing: the
blueprint says "in a finite graph", but finiteness is used there only to terminate the ear
*process*, never to find one shortest path.

A minimum-length walk is automatically a path (`Graph.IsWalk.isPath_of_minLength`). The proof
is the induction of `Graph.IsWalk.contains_path` run once more, with lengths attached: if the
step's source were revisited later, `Graph.IsPath.from_visited` would cut the tail down to a
strictly shorter walk with the same ends, and a path's edge list repeats nothing
(`Graph.IsPath.nodup`), so the cut piece really is no longer than what it came from
(`List.subperm_of_subset`).

## The two neighbours, without a contradiction

The blueprint argues by contradiction: "otherwise its unique neighbour would be a cut vertex".
Here the two neighbours are *constructed*, in the shape `Graph.IsTwoConnected.no_bridge`
already uses. A walk from the component out to a vertex of `S` crosses the boundary
(`Graph.IsWalk.crossing`), and the crossing edge's far end is in `S` — because a neighbour
outside `S` would still be in the component. That is the first neighbour `c`. For the second,
delete `c`: the big graph is still connected, so the same crossing argument runs inside
`G - c`, and its crossing edge's far end is a neighbour that is not `c`.

Two distinct vertices of `S` are needed, and used exactly once: the walk of the second step
must aim at a vertex of `S` other than `c`. In the application `S` is the vertex set of a
2-connected subgraph, which has three.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.component`, `Graph.induce_component_connected` — "a component `L` of `G - V(H₀)`" in
  the proof of `lem:relative-ear`.
* `Graph.exists_minLength_isPath` — "a shortest path through `L`", same proof.
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.component_two_neighbors` — "if a component `L` of `G - V(H₀)` contains
  a vertex, it has at least two distinct neighbors in `H₀`; otherwise its unique neighbor
  would be a cut vertex of `G`".
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_path_through_component` — "a shortest path through `L` between
  two such neighbors is an ear": a path of `G` between two distinct vertices of `S`, whose
  every other vertex is outside `S`, which has at least one such vertex, and each of whose
  edges has an end outside `S`. The word *ear* is not used here and nothing about ears is
  assumed; this is the raw path that a consumer recognises as one.

/-- The component of `u` in `G`: the vertices `u` reaches. A comprehension over the vertices,
not an indexed union of connected subgraphs; the membership test is `Graph.Reaches` itself,
which is why every closure property below is one line of the reachability API.

No `v ∈ V(G)` clause: `Graph.Reaches` already carries it, since the empty walk demands a
vertex of the graph. For `u ∉ V(G)` the component is empty. -/

one of `G.deleteVerts S`. Only two facts about the deletion are used, and both are about where
its walks can go. -/

This is `Graph.IsWalk.crossing` plus the previous lemma: the crossing edge's far end is
outside the component, so it cannot be outside `S`. -/

`lem:relative-ear`, with the blueprint's contradiction turned into a construction.

`S` must contain two distinct vertices; in the application it is the vertex set of a
2-connected subgraph, which has three. The first neighbour `c` comes from a walk of `G` out of
the component to a vertex of `S`; the second from the same walk run inside `G - c`, which is
still connected because `G` is 2-connected, and aimed at a vertex of `S` other than `c`. -/

*ear*: in a 2-connected `G`, from a vertex outside a set `S` that has two distinct vertices,
one gets a path of `G` whose two endpoints are distinct vertices of `S`, whose every other
vertex is outside `S`, which has at least one vertex outside `S`, and each of whose edges has
an end outside `S`.

The last two clauses are what make the ear process terminate and what make the path *new*: it
really does add a vertex, and none of its edges belongs to a subgraph whose vertices all lie
in `S`.

The path is built from the two neighbours of the component: the edge into the component, a
path across the component (in `G - S`, hence never touching `S`), and the edge back out. -/
