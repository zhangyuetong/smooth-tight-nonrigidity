# `lem:k33` and `cor:k33-subdivision`, with nothing assumed

`Schoenflies/Graph/K33Planar.lean` proves the nonplanarity of `K(3,3)` from
`Graph.IsHexRealization`; `Schoenflies/Graph/K33Closed.lean` reduces that to `Graph.Bendable` —
"every polygonal drawing can be redrawn so that no two edges leave a vertex along one line". This
module removes the hypothesis altogether. Nothing is bent.

## Where the hypothesis came from, and why it is not needed

`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon` carries a `corner` field, and
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` shows the field is not slack: *every* vertex of
*every* `ClosedPolygon` presentation is a point at which the curve turns. So a crosscut interface
phrased with `ClosedPolygon`s — `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut`, and hence
`Schoenflies.alternating_crosscuts` — can only cut the curve at corners, and a drawn `K(3,3)` puts
its branch points wherever it likes.

The blueprint's `cor:alternating-crosscuts` has no such condition: it is stated for a set-level
simple closed polygonal curve and simple polygonal arcs with endpoints anywhere on it. The fix is
to state the crosscut for `Schoenflies.PrePolygon` — `ClosedPolygon` without `corner` — whose
vertices may sit anywhere on the curve. `Schoenflies/PrePolygonSep.lean` already supplies the two
things Theorem 2.8 asks of such a curve: that its carrier separates the plane, and the two values
of the crossing parity. Everything else in the chain is about *edge lists*, and edge lists do not
know about corners.

## The one construction this needed

Three closed polygons enter Theorem 2.8 — the curve `C` and the two curves `Jᵢ` the crosscut
forms with the two arcs — and their **edge lists** must agree: `SameEdges Jᵢ.pieces (Aᵢ ++ K)`.
`Schoenflies/Graph/K33Closed.lean` found three realizations independently and matched them with
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.arcPieces_eq`, whose proof is exactly where `corner` was consumed. For
`PrePolygon` no such matching theorem can exist: two presentations of one arc need not agree.

So the two spliced curves are not found — they are *built*. `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_splice`
lays two chains with common ends end to end and returns a `PrePolygon` whose edge list is their
concatenation, so the three lists agree by construction and nothing has to be matched. The chains
themselves come from `Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_arcs_oriented`, which needs
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.insertLast` of `Schoenflies/PrePolygonArc.lean`: a point of the curve that
is not yet a vertex is interior to an edge, and an edge may be cut. That is the inverse of
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.deleteLast`, and it is what makes "a `PrePolygon` may be presented with
vertices at any prescribed finite set of points of its carrier" a theorem
(`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_prePolygon_vertices`).

## What this module rests on

The `Schoenflies.PrePolygon` arc apparatus — `chain`, `arcPieces`, `arc`, `arc_inter`,
`isArcBetween_arc`, `parity_splitting`, `parity_ne_iff_mem_farRegion`, `insertLast`,
`exists_prePolygon_vertices`, `Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_split` and the segment-cutting
lemmas — is in `Schoenflies/PrePolygonArc.lean`, shared with `Schoenflies/FaceCyclesLand.lean`.
Only what is peculiar to the crosscut wiring is left here.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_splice` — two arcs with common ends, laid end to end.
* `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.reverse`, `…reverse_arc`, `…sameEdges_reverse_arcPieces` — the polygon
  traversed the other way, which is what pins the direction of a prescribed arc.
* `Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_arcs`, `…exists_prePolygon_arcs_oriented` — §1, the realization
  theorem **with the cut points anywhere on the curve**, tracking a prescribed splitting.
  Compare `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_arcs`, which requires the cut points to be corners.
* `Schoenflies.IsPrePolygonalCrosscut` and its API up to
  `…alternating_inter_nonempty_of_same_side` — `thm:polygonal-crosscut` and
  `cor:alternating-crosscuts` in the blueprint's own generality: the split points need not be
  corners.
* `Graph.IsPreHexCrosscut`, `Graph.IsK33Config.isPreHexCrosscut` — the six-cycle of a polygonally
  drawn `K(3,3)`, cut at the two ends of one remaining edge, as such a crosscut. **This is what
  `Graph.IsHexRealization` was assuming, and it is proved here.**
* `Graph.IsK33Config.false_of_isPreHexCrosscut`, `…false_of_polygonal`,
  `Graph.IsK33Config.not_exists_isDrawing` — `lem:k33`.
* `Graph.IsArcK33.elim`, `Graph.IsK33Subdivision.elim` — `cor:k33-subdivision`.
* `Graph.k33Graph_not_exists_isDrawing` — `lem:k33` for the concrete graph.

## A note on names, for the integrator

The direct statements use eliminator-style names because the realization-parametric lemmas are
still in the import closure:

| realization-parametric lemma                      | direct theorem                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing` (K33Planar)      | `Graph.IsK33Config.not_exists_isDrawing`   |
| `Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing_of_bendable`      | `Graph.IsK33Config.not_exists_isDrawing`   |
| `Graph.IsArcK33.false_of_realization`/`_bendable`  | `Graph.IsArcK33.elim`                      |
| `Graph.IsK33Subdivision.false_of_realization`/`…`  | `Graph.IsK33Subdivision.elim`              |
| `Graph.k33Graph_not_isDrawing`                     | `Graph.k33Graph_not_exists_isDrawing`      |

With this module in place `Graph.IsHexRealization`, `Graph.IsHexCrosscut`, `Graph.IsHexGeneric`
and `Graph.Bendable` have no consumers left.

/-! ## Splicing two chains into a closed polygon

The crosscut of Theorem 2.8 asks for three closed polygons whose *edge lists* fit together, and
independent realizations of three curves do not. The way out is to realize only the curve `C`,
and to build the two spliced curves out of one arc of `C` and one presentation of the crosscut —
so that the three edge lists agree by construction. This is that construction: two chains with
the same pair of ends, meeting only there, laid end to end. -/

/-- **Two arcs with common ends splice into a closed polygon whose edge list is their
concatenation.** `P.arcPieces a k` runs from `p` to `q` and `P'.arcPieces b l` runs from `q` back
to `p`; the two meet only at `p` and `q`. -/

the two cut points among its vertices, with no corner condition on them. What remains is to say
*which* arc of that presentation is which of two prescribed arcs, and in which direction the
first is traversed. -/

/-! ## Theorem 2.8 and Corollary 2.9 for a polygon presented with redundant vertices

`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut` is stated for `ClosedPolygon`s, and by
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` that pins the two cut points to be *corners* of the
curve. Nothing in the proof of Theorem 2.8 needs the `corner` field: what it uses of `C`, `J₁`,
`J₂` is that their carriers separate the plane and that their crossing counts are the ones the
edge lists compute. `Schoenflies/PrePolygonSep.lean` supplies both for a `PrePolygon`, so the
whole chain goes through with the cut points anywhere on the curve. -/

remaining edge forms with the two halves are then *built* from that realization and from one
presentation of the remaining edge, rather than found independently. That is what makes the three
edge lists agree, and it is why no matching lemma, and hence no general position, is needed. -/

copy of `K(3,3)` has no plane drawing.

`lem:polygonal-redrawing` replaces an arbitrary drawing by a polygonal one on the same graph and
the same vertices; the contradiction is then `false_of_polygonal`. This is
`Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing` of `Schoenflies/Graph/K33Planar.lean` with its realization
hypothesis discharged, and `Graph.IsK33Config.not_isDrawing_of_bendable` of
`Schoenflies/Graph/K33Closed.lean` with `Graph.Bendable` discharged: no drawing has to be bent,
because the crosscut no longer needs the six vertices to be corners. -/
