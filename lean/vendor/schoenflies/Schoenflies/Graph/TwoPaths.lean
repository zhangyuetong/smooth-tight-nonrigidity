# A cycle, as two paths sharing their ends, is 2-connected

`lem:union-two-connected` says a union of two 2-connected graphs sharing two vertices is
2-connected. Its companion is the base case: a *cycle* — two internally disjoint paths with the
same two ends — is 2-connected, and neither path is 2-connected on its own, so the union lemma
cannot deliver it.

Stated for an ambient graph `K` that the two paths cover, rather than for `Graph.union`, so
that a geometric consumer never has to prove a graph equality — which is the form in which the
consumers actually arrive.

This is the general lemma extracted from a second, independent attempt at
`Schoenflies.squaresTwoConnected` (the one that landed is `Schoenflies/SquareCycle.lean`, by a
different route). It is kept because it is reusable and because at least two consumers want it:
the anchored square mesh of `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, whose collar rectangles are attached
one cycle at a time, and any later argument that has to see a subdivided closed curve as a
2-connected graph.

/-- **A graph covered by two paths with the same two ends, meeting only there, is
2-connected.**

Stated for an ambient graph `K` that the two paths cover, rather than for `Graph.union`, so
that a geometric consumer never has to prove a graph equality.

Deleting a vertex `c`: every surviving vertex reaches an end of its own path
(`Graph.IsPathGraph.reaches_an_end`).  If `c` is neither end, then `c` misses one of the two
paths — they share only `u` and `v` — and that whole path still joins `u` to `v`, so `u` is a
hub.  If `c` is an end, the branch reaching it is impossible (a deleted vertex is reached by
nothing) and the other end is the hub. -/
