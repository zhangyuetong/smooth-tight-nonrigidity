# Trees

A tree is a connected graph in which no edge lies on a cycle. What the blueprint asks of a
tree is always about its leaves, and every such question starts the same way: **take a longest
path**. Neither of its ends can carry a second edge — an edge back onto the path would close a
cycle, and an edge off the path would make a longer path — so both ends are leaves.

## The three theorems this file exists for

* deleting a leaf leaves a tree (`Graph.IsTree.delete_leaf`),
* a tree on `n` vertices has `n - 1` edges (`Graph.IsTree.edge_count`), by peeling leaves,
* **a tree with exactly three leaves has one vertex of degree three**
  (`Graph.IsTree.three_leaves`), which is where the handshake lemma finally pays.

## Why a longest path rather than a maximal one

A longest path is produced by `Nat.findGreatest` over the lengths of paths, bounded because a
path repeats no edge (`Graph.IsPath.nodup`) and the graph has finitely many. That needs
`Graph.Finite` and nothing else — in particular no well-founded recursion and no choice of a
maximal element in an order. The bound is the only place finiteness enters the longest-path
argument.

## Vertex deletion

`Graph.deleteVerts` is Mathlib's. What this file adds is the transfer lemma every deletion
argument reduces to — `Graph.IsWalk.deleteVerts`, a walk that never visits a deleted vertex
survives — together with the reason the hypothesis is ever available:
`Graph.IsLeaf.path_avoids`, a path whose two ends are elsewhere never visits a vertex of
degree one. To pass through such a vertex a path would have to arrive and leave along its
single edge, and a path takes no edge twice.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsTree.three_leaves` — `lem:three-leaf-tree` ("a finite tree with exactly three
  leaves has exactly one vertex of degree at least three; that vertex has degree exactly
  three, and every other vertex is a leaf or has degree two"), used at the H5 step of
  `lem:two-components` to produce the three internally disjoint branches of each spanning
  tree `T_i`.
* `Graph.IsTree.edge_count` — the same lemma's "a finite tree with `n` vertices has exactly
  `n - 1` edges".
* `Graph.IsTree.has_leaf`, `Graph.IsTree.delete_leaf` — its "a tree with an edge has a leaf,
  since an endpoint of a maximal simple path has no neighbor off the path, and a second
  neighbor on the path would close a cycle; deleting a leaf and its edge leaves a tree".
* `Graph.IsTree` — the trees of `lem:two-components` ("take a minimal connected subgraph
  `T_i` spanning the three terminals. It is a tree").
