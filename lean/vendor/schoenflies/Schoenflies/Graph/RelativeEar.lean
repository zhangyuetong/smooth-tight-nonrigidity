# The relative ear decomposition

`lem:relative-ear`: *if `H` is a 2-connected subgraph of a finite 2-connected graph `G`, then
`G` is obtained from `H` by repeatedly adding paths whose distinct endpoints are already
present and whose internal vertices are new.*

Two things are delivered, and they are different in kind.

* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_ear_exists` — the **relative** ear: the blueprint's own
  construction, through a component of `G - V(K)`, which is what makes the internal vertices
  new. `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_exists` in `Schoenflies/Graph/Ear.lean` finds *an* ear by a
  crossing walk, but says nothing about where the ear's interior lies — its path may run back
  and forth through the subgraph. That is enough to make the subgraph grow; it is **not**
  enough for the consumers, which need "whose internal vertices are new" verbatim (the ear's
  interior must be disjoint from the current skeleton, so that it lies in one current face).
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition` — the **iterated** form, as an induction principle.
  `Graph.IsTwoConnected.grows_by_ear` is deliberately one step; the finiteness induction the
  blueprint hides behind "finiteness terminates the process" is done here.

## Why the relative form is a different theorem

The blueprint's proof does not walk out of the subgraph and hope. It looks at a component `L`
of `G - V(H₀)`: if `L` has a vertex it has two distinct neighbours in `H₀`, since otherwise
its unique neighbour would be a cut vertex of `G`, and a shortest path through `L` between two
such neighbours is an ear. That path meets `V(H₀)` only at its two ends **by construction**,
because its interior was built inside `G - V(H₀)`.

All of that is already proved: `Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_path_through_component` in
`Schoenflies/Graph/Component.lean` packages the component argument and the path through it.
What is left here is to feed it `S = V(K)` — the two distinct vertices of `S` it asks for are
two of the three that a 2-connected `K` has — and to read its "every edge has an end outside
`S`" as "no edge of the ear is an edge of `K`".

The degenerate branch is the blueprint's second sentence: if every vertex of `G` is already
present, a missing edge is an ear of length one, and it has no internal vertex at all. As in
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_exists`, that branch — and only that branch — needs `G` to be
loopless: a loop added to a 2-connected graph leaves it 2-connected, and no ear between
*distinct* endpoints can supply it.

## The termination measure

Edges, not vertices: `(E(G) \ E(B)).ncard`, which is finite because `G` is. Every ear
contributes at least one edge that `B` did not have — in the relative form *every* edge of the
ear is new, since each has an end outside `V(B)` — so the measure strictly drops, and the
process stops exactly when `B = G`. The stopping step is `Graph.eq_of_le_of_subset_subset`: a
subgraph with all the vertices and all the edges is the graph.

Note that the measure never needs to see a vertex. It is tempting to stop when `E(B) = E(G)`
and argue that a connected `G` has no isolated vertex; that is true but needs the degree
theory, and is unnecessary: if `V(B) ≠ V(G)` the ear that the first branch produces has an
edge outside `E(B)`, so the measure was not zero after all.

## One import that looks wrong

`Schoenflies/Graph/Tree.lean` is imported for a single two-line fact, `Graph.IsPath.ne_nil` —
a path between distinct vertices has an edge — which happens to live there. Nothing else in
this file has anything to do with trees. The honest fix is for the integrator to hoist
`Graph.IsPath.ne_nil` into `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean`, where it belongs, and drop the
import; it is not restated here.

## What the induction principle gives a consumer

`motive G`, from `motive K` and one step. The step is handed the ear in full — the path `D` of
`G`, its distinct ends in `V(B)`, and the freshness of its interior — together with
`B.IsTwoConnected`, `K ≤ B` and `B ≤ G`, and must produce `motive (B.union (G.pathGraphOf a D))`.
That is exactly the shape of the induction in `lem:face-cycles` ("suppose it holds for the
current graph and add the next geometric ear") and of the finite transfer of Part II.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_ear_exists` — `lem:relative-ear`, the ear itself: "a shortest
  path through `L` between two such neighbours is an ear", plus "if all vertices are already
  present, add a missing edge as an ear of length one".
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_grows_by_ear` — the same, glued on: one step of "`G` is
  obtained from `H` by repeatedly adding paths".
* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition` — `lem:relative-ear` in full, including
  "finiteness terminates the process", as an induction principle.

/-! ### Two facts about a subgraph inclusion

Both are general and neither is in `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean`; the integrator may want to
hoist them. -/

/-- **An edge of a subgraph has its ends in the subgraph**, even when the incidence is only
known in the big graph. This is what turns "every edge of the ear has an end outside `V(K)`"
into "no edge of the ear is an edge of `K`". -/

/-! ### The relative ear -/

/-- **`lem:relative-ear`, the ear.** A 2-connected subgraph `K` of a loopless 2-connected `G`
that is missing a vertex or an edge has a *relative* ear: a path of `G` whose two distinct
endpoints lie in `K`, whose every other vertex lies **outside** `K`, and none of whose edges
belongs to `K`.

This is the blueprint's own construction, and the freshness of the interior is what
distinguishes it from `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_exists`. The first branch takes a component
`L` of `G - V(K)` and a path across it between two of its neighbours in `K`
(`Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_path_through_component`); the two distinct vertices of `V(K)`
that construction needs are supplied by the counting clause of `K.IsTwoConnected`. The second
branch is the blueprint's "if all vertices are already present, add a missing edge as an ear
of length one", and it is the only place looplessness is used. -/

that `K` did not have.

The ear data is handed back alongside the enlarged graph, because a consumer of the geometric
version needs the *path*, not merely the fact that the subgraph grew. -/

/-! ### Reading the enlarged graph

Two unfoldings a consumer of the induction principle below needs immediately, since the step's
conclusion is about `B.union (G.pathGraphOf a D)`. Both are immediate from the simp lemmas of
`Schoenflies/Graph/TwoConnected.lean` and `Schoenflies/Graph/PathGraph.lean`; they are here
only so that no consumer has to rediscover which two to combine. -/

@[simp]
theorem vertexSet_union_pathGraphOf (B G : Graph α β) (a : α) (D : List β) :
    V(B.union (G.pathGraphOf a D)) = V(B) ∪ G.walkVertices a D := rfl

    E(B.union (G.pathGraphOf a D)) = E(B) ∪ {e | e ∈ D} := by
  rw [edgeSet_union, pathGraphOf_edgeSet h]

/-! ### Iterating: the decomposition itself -/

/-- **`lem:relative-ear`.** A 2-connected subgraph `K` of a finite loopless 2-connected graph
`G` grows to `G` by repeatedly adding relative ears, stated as the induction principle a
consumer uses: whatever holds of `K` and survives the addition of one ear holds of `G`.

The step is given the whole ear — the path `D` of `G`, its two distinct ends in the current
subgraph `B`, and the fact that its other vertices are outside `B` — together with
`B.IsTwoConnected`, `K ≤ B` and `B ≤ G`.

"Finiteness terminates the process" is the strong induction below on `(E(G) \ E(B)).ncard`:
every ear contributes an edge of `G` that `B` was missing, and the process can only be stuck
when `B` has all of `G`'s vertices and edges, which makes `B = G`. -/
