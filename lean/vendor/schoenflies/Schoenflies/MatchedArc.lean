# Matching and cutting simple polygonal arcs

An ear can have an arbitrary finite number of abstract edges.  On the target side we only
obtain one set-level polygonal crosscut.  This module supplies the two facts that reconcile
those descriptions.

* Two named arcs admit an endpoint-preserving homeomorphism, obtained by matching their
  parameters.
* An arc contained in a polygonal arc is polygonal.  Consequently the images of all source
  edge arcs under the parameter-matching homeomorphism are polygonal target edge arcs.
