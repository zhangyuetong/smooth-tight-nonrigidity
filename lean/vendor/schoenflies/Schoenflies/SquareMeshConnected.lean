# The inner grid of the anchored square mesh: 2-connectivity and the outer cycle

`Schoenflies/SquareMesh.lean` delivers the geometry of `prop:anchored-square-mesh` — the
diameter bound, the anchors, the inward edges at the fresh points, and connectedness of
`|T| ∖ S` — and leaves two clauses open, both of them combinatorial:

* clause 5, *the skeleton of `T` is 2-connected*, is absent;
* clause 3 is proved only as a point-set equation, never as a **cycle** of the graph.

This module supplies both for the object the blueprint's own proof of the proposition is about:
the **rectangular grid**. See "What this does and does not close" below for exactly what the
integrator still has to do.

## The grid, concretely

Two coordinate functions `xc yc : ℕ → ℝ` and two sizes `m n : ℕ` fix a grid: the vertices are
the `(m+1)(n+1)` points `gridPt xc yc i j = (xc i, yc j)`, the edges are the `m(n+1)`
horizontal steps `gridHEdge` and the `(m+1)n` vertical steps `gridVEdge`. Everything is a
`def` — an existentially quantified grid could not be refined against a second one, which is
what Part II does.

The hypotheses on the coordinates are exactly as strong as each statement needs, and no
stronger: 2-connectivity needs only that **consecutive** coordinates differ, the outer cycle
needs the coordinates **distinct** (`Set.InjOn xc (Set.Iic m)`), and only the drawing — the
clause that makes the grid a plane graph — needs them **increasing**
(`StrictMonoOn xc (Set.Iic m)`).

The graph is `pieceListGraph (gridEdges xc yc m n)`, where `pieceListGraph` is the general
"a list of straight segments, read as a graph" constructor: an edge is a `Piece`, and it links
exactly its two ends. `pieceListGraph` is `overlayGraph` without the subdivision — the vertices
are the ends of the listed segments and nothing is cut — and its point is that
`pieceListGraph l₁ ∪ pieceListGraph l₂ = pieceListGraph (l₁ ++ l₂)` **on the nose**
(`pieceListGraph_union`), so that the blueprint's "add these finitely many cycles one at a
time" is list concatenation and every union is an equation rather than an inclusion.

## 2-connectivity: two nested chains of `lem:union-two-connected`

The blueprint says "the inner grid is 2-connected by the same ear construction used for `K`".
The ear construction is replaced here by two applications of `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union`,
which is shorter and needs no ear at all:

* one **cell** — the boundary of a single rectangle of the grid — is a quadrilateral, and
  `Graph.isTwoConnected_of_quad` proves any quadrilateral 2-connected directly from the
  definition (delete a vertex; the other three are still a path);
* a **strip** (one column of cells) is the union of its cells, consecutive cells sharing the
  horizontal edge between them, hence two vertices;
* the **grid** is the union of its strips, consecutive strips sharing the whole vertical line
  between them, hence again two vertices.

Both chains need at least two vertices in common at every step, so both need `1 ≤ m` and
`1 ≤ n`: a grid with a single row of points is a path and is not 2-connected. That is the
degenerate case, and it is a hypothesis, not an oversight.

## The outer cycle

The boundary walk goes once round the four sides, `gridBoundaryEdge` and `gridBoundaryPt`
naming the `2m + 2n` edges and vertices in order by a four-way `if` on the index. Everything
about the walk is then arithmetic in `ℕ`, which `omega` decides.
`gridGraph_isCycleThrough_boundary` is a `Graph.IsCycleThrough` of the grid graph — the
distinguished outer cycle — and `edgesCover_gridBoundary` computes what it occupies: for
increasing coordinates it is exactly the frame of the bounding rectangle, and for the grid on
`[-1,1]²` that frame is `modelCurve`, i.e. `S` (`edgesCover_gridBoundary_modelCurve`,
`gridGraph_outer_cycle`). That is the cycle `thm:finite-transfer`(b) asks for, in the form it
asks for it.

The grid is also shown to be a **plane graph** (`gridGraph_isDrawing`), so the outer cycle is a
Jordan curve (`gridBoundary_isJordanCurve`) and the whole face machinery applies to it.

## What this does and does not close

**Closed.** Both clauses, for the rectangular grid, from an explicit construction, together
with the drawing that makes the grid a plane graph.

**Not closed.** Neither clause is transported to `Schoenflies.squareMesh`, and the reason is
structural, not a matter of effort: `squareMesh` is `overlayGraph` applied to a list of
segments *and an unspecified list of cut points* obtained from `exists_cut_points` by choice.
Its edges are therefore the pieces of a subdivision nobody can enumerate, so neither "the
edges on `S` form a cycle" nor "the rings are cycles glued along the spokes" is available
without first proving that the subdivision of a segment at a finite point set is a **path** —
a theorem no module on `main` has. The honest statement of the missing collar step is
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.attach_cycles` below: it takes a 2-connected hub `K` and finitely many
2-connected pieces each meeting `K` in two distinct vertices, and concludes for the union.
Instantiating it at `squareMesh` needs the collar rectangles of the mesh as cycles, which is
exactly the enumeration that is missing.

**A degenerate case that would have to be excluded.** `squareMesh δ fresh anchors` is *not*
2-connected when `fresh` has fewer than two distinct points, so the missing theorem cannot be
stated without a hypothesis. With `fresh = []` the mesh is `meshCount δ` pairwise disjoint
concentric ring frames and is not even connected. With one fresh point `z` the spoke at `z` is
the only thing joining the rings, so every vertex of that spoke is a cut vertex: deleting the
one at radius `k/N` separates the rings inside it from the rings outside. Two fresh points are
what make the rings and the two spokes a chain of quadrilaterals, which is the same picture the
grid presents here. The corresponding hypothesis for the grid is `1 ≤ m` and `1 ≤ n`, and it is
carried explicitly by every theorem below that needs it.

## Blueprint

* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 5, for the inner grid — `gridGraph_isTwoConnected`.
* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 3, as a cycle — `gridGraph_isCycleThrough_boundary`
  together with `edgesCover_gridBoundary`, `edgesCover_gridBoundary_modelCurve` and the
  packaged `gridGraph_outer_cycle`.
* `lem:polygonal-overlay`, the drawing clause, for the grid — `gridGraph_isDrawing`.
* `lem:union-two-connected` — used through `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union`; iterated here as
  `Graph.IsTwoConnected.attach_cycles`, which is the blueprint's "adding these finitely many
  cycles one at a time".
* `pieceListGraph`, `pieceListGraph_union` — the list-of-segments graph, and the fact that its
  unions are concatenations.

The base case of both chains below. The blueprint reaches it through the ear decomposition
(`lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` applied to a cycle); here it is read straight off the

"delete one vertex and the rest is still connected" is four applications of one lemma. -/

/-! ### Attaching finitely many pieces to a 2-connected hub

`prop:anchored-square-mesh`: *"The boundary of every collar rectangle is a cycle sharing with
the inner grid at least the two endpoints of its inner boundary arc. Adding these finitely many
cycles one at a time and applying `lem:union-two-connected` proves that the full mesh is
2-connected."*

`Graph.chainUnion_isTwoConnected` (`Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean`) iterates the same lemma along
a chain in which **consecutive** members meet. Here every piece meets the **hub**, which is
what the collar rectangles do — each meets the inner grid, but two collar rectangles on
opposite sides of the square meet nothing of each other. The two statements are independent;
the integrator may want them beside each other. -/

The boundary walk of the grid is a march: vertices `p s, p (s+1), …` joined by edges
`q s, q (s+1), …`. The freshness clause of `Graph.IsPath` is then exactly the injectivity of
`p` on the index range, because an edge of the chain is incident with nothing but its own two

/-! ### The graph carried by a list of segments

`overlayGraph` subdivides; this does not. When the segments are already in general position —
which for a grid they are, by construction — no subdivision is wanted, and what is gained is
that unions are concatenations.

`Schoenflies/ArcComplement.lean` has the same construction indexed by a `Set Piece`, under the
name `segGraph`, and `pieceListGraph l` is `segGraph {P | P ∈ l}`. The two were written in
parallel and collided at merge; they are kept apart for now because this module's proofs run on
the list and the other's on the set. If a third consumer appears, hoist the set version into
`Schoenflies/OverlayGraph.lean` beside `endSet` and derive this one from it. -/

/-! ### The rectangular grid

/-! ### The outer cycle

The boundary of the grid, walked once anticlockwise from the corner `(0,0)`: `m` steps right
along the bottom, `n` up the right side, `m` back along the top, `n` down the left side. The
walk is parametrised by an index `t < 2m + 2n`, and both the vertex and the edge at index `t`
are given by a four-way `if`. Everything about the walk then reduces to arithmetic in `ℕ`,
which `omega` decides; the geometry enters only in `edgesCover_gridBoundary` at the end. -/

/-! ### What the outer cycle occupies

Up to here nothing has been asked of the order of the coordinates. It is asked now: the union
of the boundary edges is the frame of the bounding rectangle only if the coordinates increase,
and the proof is the one-dimensional fact `Set.Icc_union_Icc_eq_Icc` transported along
`Schoenflies.mem_segment_horiz` / `mem_segment_vert`. -/

/-! ### The grid is a plane graph

Sorted coordinates make the drawing clause a coordinate computation. A point of a horizontal
grid edge has the row's `y`-coordinate and an `x`-coordinate in one closed coordinate interval;
strict monotonicity turns "`xc a` lies in `[xc i, xc (i+1)]`" into "`a = i` or `a = i+1`", and
that single step settles both remaining clauses of `Graph.IsDrawing`. -/
