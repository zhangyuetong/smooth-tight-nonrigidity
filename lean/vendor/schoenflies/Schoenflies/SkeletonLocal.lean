# Local structure of a polygonal skeleton

Close enough to any of its points, a finite union of segments and points looks like a *star*:
the point itself together with finitely many radial segments leaving it, one per local branch.
This module proves that, and hands the accessibility argument the form it needs.

## What is exported, and why in this shape

The data is `Schoenflies.localDirs S x`, the set of unit vectors `d` such that some initial
segment `[x, x + ε • d]` lies in `S`. It is defined for an arbitrary set, with no choices in
it: nothing about a segment decomposition of `S` enters the definition, so no consumer has to
carry one. "Pairwise distinct directions" is then not a clause to be proved but the meaning of
the word *set*, and the blueprint's real content becomes `localDirs_finite`.

The radius is the one genuinely existential ingredient — there is no canonical `r₀` — so it is
named by a predicate rather than returned inside an `∃`-packaged bundle of properties:

  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius S x r` : `0 < r`, and every point within `r` of `x` lies in `S`
  exactly when it is `x` itself or leaves `x` in a local direction.

That single membership criterion is equivalent to the blueprint's picture and implies all of
its parts, each proved here as a lemma about `IsLocalRadius` and hence available at every
radius below the one produced: the closed-disk formula
(`IsLocalRadius.closedBall_inter`), the open disk minus `S` as a *cone* over the complement of
the local rays (`IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_cone`), and the star-shapedness that the
accessibility lemma actually cites (`IsLocalRadius.openSegment_subset_ball_diff`).

## What the consumer (`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`) needs

That lemma takes `y` in a face `F` inside the disk, and wants a polygonal arc from `x` into
`F`. `IsLocalRadius.openSegment_subset_ball_diff` gives `(x, y) ⊆ B(x, r) \ S` directly, and
`openSegment ℝ x y ∪ {y}` is connected and disjoint from the skeleton — which is everything
the blueprint's "pick the sector containing `y`, then a short segment from `x` into it" is used
for. The decomposition of the punctured disk into its *individual* sectors, one per pair of
cyclically adjacent local directions, is therefore **not** proved here: it needs a cyclic
order on directions, and no consumer needs it. `IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_cone` records the
sectors in aggregate — as one `Plane.cone` over all free directions at once.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.localDirs`, `Schoenflies.localDirs_finite` — the finitely many local branch
  directions at `x` of Lemma "Local structure of a polygonal skeleton"
  (`lem:local-skeleton-structure`).
* `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius`, `Schoenflies.exists_isLocalRadius`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.closedBall_inter` — the radius `r₀`, and "for every `0 < r ≤ r₀`
  the closed disk meets `|G|` exactly in finitely many straight segments from `x` with
  pairwise distinct directions" (same lemma).
* `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_cone` — "consequently `B(x,r) \ |G|` is a finite
  union of open circular sectors" (same lemma), in aggregate form.
* `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.openSegment_subset_ball_diff` — the form
  `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility` cites: a short straight segment from `x` towards any
  point of the punctured disk misses the skeleton.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_cover`, `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_isLocalRadius`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.finite_localDirs` — the same statements for a finite plane graph all of
  whose edges are polygonal.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.openSegment_subset_face` — the access arc of
  `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`, assembled: a straight segment from `x` to a point of the
  exterior inside a local disk lies, minus `x`, in that point's face.

/-! ### Radial segments

`segment ℝ x (x + r • d)` with `d` a unit vector is the closed radius of length `r` leaving
`x` in the direction `d`. Two facts run the whole module: a point lies on it exactly when it
is near enough and points the right way (`mem_radial_iff`), and cutting a longer radius by a
smaller ball leaves the shorter radius (`radial_inter_closedBall`). -/

the consumer picks `y` in the face it cares about (possible because the face accumulates at
`x`), shrinks the radius with `IsLocalRadius.mono` until the disk also misses whatever else it
must avoid, and reads off a polygonal access arc. No sector has to be named: the half-open
