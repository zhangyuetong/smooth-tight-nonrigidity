# The Jordan curve theorem

The complement of a Jordan curve has exactly two regions, one bounded and one unbounded, and
both have the curve as their boundary. That is `Schoenflies.IsSeparating C` — the very
predicate `Schoenflies/CrosscutCells.lean` introduces and
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.polygonal_jordan` establishes for a polygon — so every consumer of
the polygonal case applies verbatim to the general one, `inside C` and `outside C` included.

Everything here takes one hypothesis, carried explicitly through every statement
that needs it:

    harc : ∀ A : Set Plane, IsArc A → IsConnected Aᶜ

which is `thm:arc-complement`, the complement of a simple arc is connected. Nothing else is
assumed; in particular no part of `thm:jordan` itself is.

## The two theorems

`lem:accessible-dense` (`Schoenflies.accessible_dense`) says the points of `C` reachable from a
fixed `x ∉ C` by a polygonal arc meeting `C` only at its endpoint are dense in `C`. Its proof
is the blueprint's: delete a small open subarc `J₀`, leaving a simple arc whose complement is
connected by `harc`; join `x` there to a point of another component of `Cᶜ`; the joining chain
must cross `C`, and it can only do so inside `J₀`.

`thm:jordan` (`Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.isSeparating`) then needs "at most two components",
which is `Schoenflies.not_three_components`, and the boundary clause, which is
`lem:accessible-dense` again: an accessible point is a limit of the region it is accessible
from, so `C` lies in the closure of each region and, being disjoint from both, in each
frontier.

## Three places where this departs from the blueprint's route

**The first meeting is taken on a vertex list, not on a parametrisation.**
`Schoenflies.exists_first_meeting` recurses on the list: on the first segment the first hit is
the infimum of the hitting parameters, and if the first segment misses the obstacle it is
swallowed by the component of the start and the recursion moves on. It returns the *initial
chain*, so both consumers — the accessibility of the meeting point, and the third branch of a
tripod — read off the same lemma.

**The tripod is built without a graph.** The blueprint overlays the three access arcs
(`lem:polygonal-overlay`), takes a minimal connected spanning subgraph, and extracts its unique
degree-three vertex by `lem:three-leaf-tree`. `Schoenflies.exists_tripod` instead joins the
first two terminals by a crosscut (`lem:accessible-endpoints`), runs a chain from the third
terminal to that crosscut, and takes the first meeting: that meeting point *is* the branch
vertex, and cutting the crosscut there (`IsArcBetween.exists_split`) gives the other two
branches. Neither `Schoenflies.polygonal_overlay` nor `Graph.IsTree.three_leaves` is used.

**The nine terminals are chosen in nine prescribed parameter windows.** The blueprint chooses
them distinct — proving that a dense set meets a nonempty relatively open subarc infinitely
often — and then *orders* the three on each closed arc `Q_j` to find the middle one `y_j`.
`Schoenflies.exists_windows` supplies nine pairwise separated windows inside `(0,1)`, in three
blocks of three; distinctness is then disjointness of the windows, the middle terminal of a
block is always the one with row index `1`, and no order on the curve is ever constructed. The
blueprint's `Q_j` never appears: only the parameter blocks `[t 0 j, t 2 j]` do.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.exists_first_meeting_segment`, `Schoenflies.exists_first_meeting`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_arc_to_first_meeting`, `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_first_meeting` — the
  first-meeting machinery `lem:accessible-dense` and `thm:jordan` both run on. General enough
  to be hoisted if a second module needs it.
* `Schoenflies.PolyAccessible.mem_closure` — an accessible point of `∂Ω` lies in `closure Ω`.
* `Schoenflies.IsLoop.compl_openArc` — `lem:jordan-circle` in the form used here: the curve
  minus an open subarc is the complementary closed arc.
* `Schoenflies.exists_polyAccessible_openArc`, `Schoenflies.accessible_dense` —
  `lem:accessible-dense`, in the parameter form the proof produces and in the closure form.
* `Schoenflies.exists_tripod` — the three internally disjoint branches of the blueprint's
  `T_i`, at the H5 step of `thm:jordan`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_windows`, `Schoenflies.uIcc_inter_uIcc_mid` — the choice of the nine
  terminals and the middle-point bookkeeping that replaces "order `p_{1j}, p_{2j}, p_{3j}`
  along `Q_j`".
* `Schoenflies.not_three_components` — the `K(3,3)` half of `thm:jordan`, through
  `Graph.IsArcK33.elim` (`cor:k33-subdivision`).
* `Schoenflies.subset_closure_of_accessible_dense`, `Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.isSeparating` —
  `thm:jordan`.

/-! ### The first meeting of a polygonal chain with a closed set

A chain that starts off a closed obstacle `S` and eventually hits it has a *first* hit, and
the piece of the chain before it never leaves the component of `U` its start lies in. This is
the only reason `lem:accessible-dense` produces an *accessible* point rather than merely a
point of the curve, and it is proved by structural recursion on the vertex list: on the first
segment the first hit is the infimum of the hitting parameters, and if the first segment
misses `S` the segment itself is swallowed by the component and the recursion moves on. -/

/-- **The first meeting on a single segment.** The parameter interval of the hits is closed and
bounded below, so it has a least element; before it the segment stays in `U`, hence in the
component of `U` carrying the near endpoint. -/

/-! ### Density of accessible points, `lem:accessible-dense`

The blueprint's proof verbatim: shrink the given relatively open arc to one whose closure is
inside it, delete it from the curve to leave a simple arc, join `x` to a point of another
component in the (connected) complement of that arc by a polygonal chain, and take the first
meeting of the chain with the curve.

The shrinking step is done on parameters. Instead of "an open arc `J₀` with closure inside
`J`" the statement below takes the open subarc `f '' Ioo a b` with `0 < a < b < 1`, which is
already strictly inside the parameter interval; every relatively open piece of the curve
contains such a subarc (`Schoenflies.basic_piece_inside_ball` supplies one inside any ball),
and that is all the blueprint's `J₀` is for. -/

/-- **`lem:accessible-dense`, in the parameter form the proof produces.** Every open subarc
strictly inside the parameter interval carries a point accessible from the component of `x`.

/-! ### The tripod at a component

The blueprint builds the three internally disjoint branches from `x_i` to the three terminals
by overlaying the three access arcs, taking a minimal connected spanning subgraph, and reading
off its unique degree-three vertex (`lem:three-leaf-tree`). The construction below reaches the
same object without a graph: join the first two terminals by a *crosscut* — a simple polygonal
arc meeting the curve exactly at its two endpoints (`lem:accessible-endpoints` in crosscut
form) — then run a chain from the third terminal into the region and on to a point of that
crosscut, and take its **first meeting** with the crosscut. That meeting point is the branch
vertex; cutting the crosscut there (`IsArcBetween.exists_split`) supplies the other two
branches.

The output is the same three internally disjoint arcs, with the same two properties every
later step uses: each meets the curve only at its terminal, and two of them meet only at the
branch vertex. -/

/-- **Three internally disjoint arcs from one point of a region to three accessible points of

/-! ### Nine parameter windows

The blueprint chooses the nine terminals `p_{ij}` distinct and then *orders* the three on each
arc `Q_j` to find the middle one `y_j`. Choosing them in nine prescribed, pairwise separated
parameter windows does both jobs at once: distinctness is disjointness of the windows, and the
middle one is always the terminal of the middle index. No order on the curve is ever
constructed.

The windows are `((6j + 2i + 2)/24, (6j + 2i + 3)/24)`, which for `i, j < 3` are nine disjoint
intervals inside `(0, 1)`, ordered lexicographically by `(j, i)`. -/

index `i` within a block, or the block index `j`, moves past the end of the current window. -/

/-! ### The Jordan curve theorem

Stated as `IsSeparating C`, the predicate `Schoenflies/CrosscutCells.lean` introduces and
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.polygonal_jordan` establishes in the polygonal case. Unfolding it,
that is exactly the blueprint's statement: `inside C` and `outside C` are each a single region,
one bounded and one unbounded (`IsSeparating.isBounded_inside`,
`IsSeparating.not_isBounded_outside`), and both have `C` as boundary. Every consumer written
against the polygonal case therefore applies verbatim. -/

/-- A point of the curve is in the closure of any region it is accessible from — the reverse
inclusion of the boundary clause, packaged for both regions at once. -/
