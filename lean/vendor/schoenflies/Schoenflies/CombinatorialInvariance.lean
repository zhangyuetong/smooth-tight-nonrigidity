# Combinatorial invariance

The first module of Part II. It introduces the abstract record of a matched cellulation, the
notion of a geometric realization of that record, and proves that everything a realization
inherits from the record is the same for two realizations of one record —
`lem:combinatorial-invariance`.

Per the blueprint's citation index this lemma has no internal prerequisites: the whole point of
the design is that the combinatorial content of the cellulation machinery is separated from all
of the geometry, so this can be built while the Jordan curve theorem is still unproved.

## What is defined here, and how faithful it is

`CellStructure` is the *abstract* record of `def:matched-cellulation`: the finite cell sets in
each dimension, the endpoint maps, the outer subcomplex, the boundary walks, and the subcell
relation. Cells of all three dimensions are names drawn from one type `γ`; the 0- and 1-cells
are the vertices and the edges of an abstract multigraph `skel : Graph γ γ`, the 2-cells are a
set `faces`, and the three collections are disjoint. What is deliberately **not** in the record:
the parent maps (they belong to a refinement — a pair of stages — not to a stage), and any
compatibility between `sub` and the realizations (that is assertion (ix) of
`lem:cellulation-invariants`, and the blueprint is explicit that `≼_abs` "enters as a raw
datum"). No reflexivity or transitivity of `sub` is assumed; the one lemma that needs
transitivity takes it as a hypothesis.

`CellStructure.Realization` is one of the two geometric realizations. The repository's plane
graphs have `V(G) : Set Plane` — vertices *are* points — so the drawn skeleton cannot literally
be the abstract graph. It is instead the pushforward `S.skel.map pos` along the positions of
the 0-cells, with `pos` injective on `V(S.skel)`. This is the representation choice of the
module, and the alternative — carrying an abstract graph isomorphism as data — was rejected
because with the pushforward "the two skeleta realize the *same* abstract graph" is a
definitional identity rather than a theorem, which is exactly what the blueprint's proof of
part (a) asserts.

The price of the choice is paid here, once: `Graph.isTwoConnected_map_iff` and
`Graph.connected_map_iff` transport connectivity along an injective relabelling of the
vertices, so that 2-connectivity of the *drawn* graph — which is what
`def:admissible-graph` requires — transfers between the realizations. Those two, and the walk
and vertex-deletion lemmas they rest on, are general facts about `Graph.map` in the root
`Graph` namespace and belong in `Schoenflies/Graph/` if a second consumer appears.

`SkeletonHomeo` is `g : |Γ| → |Γ'|` of `def:matched-pair`, as a set-level homeomorphism with
its inverse supplied as data (so that no finiteness hypothesis is needed to invert it).
Clause 3 of `def:matched-pair` is recorded in the weaker form "`g` carries each drawn edge onto
the corresponding drawn edge", which is all that is used and which the full clause implies.

## The three parts of the lemma

Only part (b) has topological content. Parts (a) and (c) are, under this representation, either
definitional identities or one-line consequences of the fact that the index sets involved are
fields of the single structure both realizations realize; that is precisely the blueprint's
argument ("all the data in (c) belong to the common abstract cell structure"), and the
statements below are shaped so that a consumer gets the geometric conclusion on *both* sides
from one combinatorial hypothesis.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure` — the abstract record of `def:matched-cellulation`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization` — one of its two geometric realizations.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.nonboundary` — the open nonboundary part
  `|Γ| \ C` of `def:admissible-graph`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.star` — the closed star `St(σ) = ⋃_{σ ≼ τ} closure τ`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SkeletonHomeo` — the skeleton homeomorphism of
  `def:matched-pair`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.combinatorial_invariance` — `lem:combinatorial-invariance`,
  assembled from:
  * (a) `Realization.graph_eq_map`, `Realization.edgeSet_graph_congr`,
    `Realization.isTwoConnected_congr`, `SkeletonHomeo.image_outerSet`;
  * (b) `SkeletonHomeo.image_nonboundary`, `SkeletonHomeo.isConnected_nonboundary_iff`;
  * (c) `Realization.star_mono`, `Realization.star_transfer`,
    `Realization.star_subset_of_sub`, `outerEdge_face_corresponds`.
* `Graph.isTwoConnected_map_iff`, `Graph.connected_map_iff` — connectivity is invariant under
  an injective relabelling of the vertices; the transport that the pushforward representation
  of a realization needs.

vertices of the skeleton, the 1-cells are its edges, and the 2-cells are `faces`. The three
collections are required to be disjoint, so "the dimension of a cell" is well defined without
being a field.

`sub` is the abstract subcell relation `≼_abs`. The blueprint is explicit that it "enters as a
raw datum" and imposes no compatibility with the realizations: that compatibility is assertion
(ix) of lem:cellulation-invariants, proved elsewhere and for generated structures only. No

The drawn graph is `S.skel.map pos` — literally the pushforward of the *one* abstract
skeleton. That is what makes "two realizations of the same abstract graph" a matter of
definition rather than of a transported isomorphism.

Nothing is required of `cell` on a 2-cell. What it would have to satisfy — that the open
2-cell is the bounded complementary region of the Jordan curve of its boundary walk — is
assertion (vii) of lem:cellulation-invariants, which is not available at this point in the

Clause 3 of def:matched-pair — "on each corresponding pair of edges, `g` restricts to a fixed
chosen homeomorphism between them, matching endpoints" — is recorded here in the weaker form
`edgeArc_image`, which says only that `g` carries each drawn edge onto the corresponding drawn
edge. That is all combinatorial invariance uses, and it is implied by the stronger clause.

Clause 2 of def:matched-pair, `g = u` on `C`, is *not* recorded: the boundary homeomorphism
`u` is not part of a cell structure. A consumer that needs the identification carries it
alongside; nothing here depends on it.

The inverse is supplied as data rather than produced from compactness, so that no finiteness
hypothesis is needed to speak of a homeomorphism; a producer holding `u⁻¹` has it anyway. -/

/-- **The 2-cell incident with an outer edge is combinatorial** — part (c) of
lem:combinatorial-invariance. There is nothing to transport: the witness is a single abstract
cell `F`, and the two realizations realize that one cell as `R₁.cell F` and `R₂.cell F`. -/

/-- **Combinatorial invariance** (lem:combinatorial-invariance), assembled.

Given two realizations of one generated matched cell structure and the skeleton
homeomorphism between them:

* (a) the two drawn skeleta are pushforwards of the same abstract graph `S.skel`, they carry
  the same edge names, 2-connectivity holds for one iff it holds for the other, and the
  realized outer cycles correspond under `g`;
* (b) the realized open nonboundary parts correspond under `g`, so one is connected iff the
  other is;
* (c) an inclusion of supercell sets — a statement of the common abstract structure — gives
  the corresponding star containment in both realizations.

The subcell relation, the parent maps and the collection of supercells of a cell do not
appear in the conclusion because under this representation they are not two objects to be
compared: they are fields of the single `S` that both realizations are realizations *of*. -/
