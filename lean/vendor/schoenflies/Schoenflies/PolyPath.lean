# Polygonal paths

A polygonal path is carried by a list of vertices; its `poly` carrier is the union of the
segments joining consecutive entries. This is the combinatorial representation the whole
of Part I works with — by the blueprint's polygonal overlay convention only finite
polygonal objects are ever overlaid, so vertex lists, not parametrizations, are the
primitive.

## Blueprint

* `poly` — the carrier of a polygonal path.
* `exists_poly_of_isPreconnected` — Lemma 1.1 (polygonal connectedness), less the passage
  to a *simple* arc, which needs the finite-graph machinery and is proved with Lemma 1.2.

/-- Lemma 1.1 (polygonal connectedness), existence half. Any two points of a region are
joined in it by a polygonal path.

The blueprint goes on to make the path *simple*, by subdividing at self-intersections and
taking a simple path in the resulting finite graph; that half is deferred to the graph
module, where the subdivision procedure is available. -/
