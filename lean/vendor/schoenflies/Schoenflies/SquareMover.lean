# Moving an interior point of the square

The pointed form of the bounded theorem needs a self-homeomorphism of the closed square that
fixes the boundary pointwise and carries one prescribed interior point to another. The
blueprint builds it by coning: the four triangles `conv {x, vᵢ, vᵢ₊₁}` triangulate the square,
and the affine map of each onto `conv {y, vᵢ, vᵢ₊₁}` fixing the two corners pastes with its
neighbours along the radial edges.

The construction here is the same map in different coordinates, and it is written so that no
pasting of four affine pieces is needed. It is the composite of two *shears*. A shear bends
one coordinate by the piecewise-linear self-map of `[-r, r]` that fixes the two endpoints and
moves a chosen breakpoint (`bend`), with a displacement that is scaled by a tent function of
the *other* coordinate (`tent`), so that it dies away to zero on the two transverse sides of
the square. The first shear moves the first coordinate of `x` to that of `y`, the second moves
the second coordinate.

Two features make this cheap. Writing the tent as a minimum of two affine functions makes it
continuous with no case split at all. And the family of shears is closed under inversion: the
shear with displacement parameters `k, k'` is undone by the shear with parameters `k + k',
-k'`, so bijectivity and the continuity of the inverse come from one composition identity
(`bend_bend`) instead of from a compactness argument, and no map has to be inverted by hand.

## Blueprint

* `Plane.exists_squareMover` — Lemma (Moving an interior point of the square): for interior
  points `x`, `y` of the square there are mutually inverse boundary-fixing self-maps `M`, `N`
  of the closed square with `M x = y`. `Plane.IsSquareMover` bundles the properties that make
  `M` a homeomorphism of the square onto itself, `Plane.IsSquareMover.homeomorph` repackages
  it as a `Homeomorph`, and `Plane.IsSquareMover.eqOn_frontier` states the boundary condition
  against the topological frontier, which `Plane.frontier_closedSquare` identifies with the
  blueprint's boundary square `S`.
* `Plane.iInter_eq_singleton_of_mem_tail` — the point-set kernel of Proposition (Skeleton
  agreement). The proposition itself is not statable in the present development; see the
  section comment at that lemma for exactly what is and is not proved.

Supporting material, of independent use: `Plane.tent` and `Plane.bend` with their algebra,
`Plane.continuousOn_bend`, the coordinate lemmas `Plane.abs_sub_le_supDist`,
`Plane.supDist_le_of_forall`, `Plane.exists_abs_sub_eq_of_supDist_eq`,
and `Plane.interior_closedSquare`.

takes the value `1` at `p`, and is linear on either side. Written as a minimum of two affine

/-! ### Moving an interior point -/

/-- Blueprint Lemma (Moving an interior point of the square). For any two interior points `x`
and `y` of the closed square about `c` of radius `r` there is a self-homeomorphism of the
square carrying `x` to `y` and fixing the boundary pointwise.

The map is built as two shears: the first moves the first coordinate of `x` to that of `y`
along the level line of `x`, the second moves the second coordinate along the level line of
the result. Each shear bends one coordinate by a piecewise-linear map whose displacement dies
away to zero at the two transverse sides, which is exactly the piecewise-affine cone
construction of the blueprint, written in coordinates. -/

/-! ### The point-set kernel of skeleton agreement

The blueprint's Proposition (Skeleton agreement) says that the limit map `F`, defined at `x`
as the unique point of the nested intersection `⋂ n, T n x` of closed target stars, agrees
with every finite skeleton map: if `x ∈ G_N ∩ D` then `F x = g_N x`. Its proof is one line of
point-set topology once the combinatorics is in place — the value `g_N x` lies in `T n x` for
every `n ≥ N`, hence in the intersection, hence is *the* point of the intersection.

That one line is what follows. The proposition itself cannot be stated in this development
yet: matched cell structures, carriers, stars, the skeleton homeomorphisms `g_n` and the limit
map `F` do not exist here. What is proved is exactly the implication the proposition rests on,
with the nested stars as an abstract antitone sequence of shrinking compacta and `g_N x` as an
abstract point of all late terms. -/

/-- If the terms of an antitone sequence of nonempty compacta have diameters tending to zero,
and a point lies in every term from some index on, then that point is the unique point of the
intersection. Blueprint Proposition (Skeleton agreement), stripped of the cell apparatus:
read `K n` as the closed target star `T n x` and `v` as the skeleton value `g_N x`. -/
