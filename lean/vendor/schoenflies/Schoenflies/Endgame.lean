# The endgame: from the square extension to the relative Jordan–Schönflies theorem

This module carries the whole tail of the manuscript — `prop:square-reduction`,
`thm:closed-interior-extension`, `prop:pointed-extension`, `prop:exterior-extension` and
`thm:main` — parametrically over the square-extension interface.

Every theorem below takes `Schoenflies.SquareExtension` as an explicit hypothesis and assumes
nothing else. In particular the standing hypothesis `harc` that older modules thread is
discharged here at the call site, from `Schoenflies.arc_complement` in
`Schoenflies/JordanClosed.lean`; it no longer appears in any signature. The implication proved
by this module is

    SquareExtension  ⟹  thm:main.

`Schoenflies/JordanSchoenflies.lean` supplies `SquareExtension` from the quantitative
boundary construction and therefore closes this implication without an extra hypothesis.

## What `SquareExtension` says

`Schoenflies.SquareExtension` is `thm:square-extension` written in the `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn`
style of `Schoenflies/Inversion.lean`: for every Jordan curve `C` and every restricted
homeomorphism `u : C → S` (with named inverse `v`) there are maps `F`, `G` restricting to
mutually inverse homeomorphisms between `C ∪ Int(C)` and `Q`, with `F = u` on `C`. Here
`S = Schoenflies.modelCurve` and `Q = Schoenflies.Plane.closedSquare 0 1`; `S = ∂Q` is
`Schoenflies.modelCurve_eq_frontier`, so this is literally the blueprint's `Q = [-1,1]²`,
`S = ∂Q`.

## The chain

* `prop:square-reduction` is the blueprint's: pick a homeomorphism `h : C' → S`
  (`lem:jordan-circle`), extend `h ∘ f` and `h` to the square, and compose one with the inverse
  of the other. `thm:closed-interior-extension` is the same statement — under the standing
  assumption of `SquareExtension` the reduction *is* the theorem — and is recorded separately
  because everything downstream cites it by that name.
* `prop:pointed-extension` is the interesting one. Given the closed-interior extension `Φ` and
  a square chart `Θ` of the *target* disc, the two points `Θ(Φ(a))` and `Θ(b)` are interior to
  `Q`, because `Θ` carries `C'` onto `∂Q` and hence — being a bijection — `Int(C')` onto
  `Q ∖ ∂Q`. `lem:square-point-mover` then supplies a boundary-fixing self-homeomorphism `M` of
  `Q` moving the first to the second, and `Θ⁻¹ ∘ M ∘ Θ ∘ Φ` is the pointed extension: it agrees
  with `Φ` on `C` because `M` fixes `∂Q` pointwise. This discharges
  `Schoenflies.PointedInteriorExtension`, the last hypothesis of `prop:exterior-extension`.
* `thm:main` is the closed pasting lemma applied twice, once to `F` and once to its inverse.
  The one point the blueprint leaves implicit is that the pasted map is *injective*: the
  interior extension carries `Int(C)` onto `Int(C')` and the exterior extension carries
  `Ext(C)` onto `Ext(C')`, so the two pieces cannot collide. Both facts are instances of
  `Schoenflies.image_eq_diff_of_bijOn_union`, which is the "a bijection matching one part of a
  partition matches the other part" principle.

## The parametric construction interface

Within this deliberately parametric module, every conclusion depends on the *Prop*
`SquareExtension`, so no `def` can produce the maps without an application of choice to that
hypothesis. What is exported as data independently of the interface is
`Schoenflies.paste` (the pasted map itself, with its two evaluation lemmas) and
`Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn.homeomorphOfUniv` (the passage from a global `IsHomeoOn` to a genuine
`Plane ≃ₜ Plane`). The theorems below return the maps in the unbundled `∃ F G, IsHomeoOn F G …`
shape of `Schoenflies.exterior_extension`, which composes.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.SquareExtension` — the **`thm:square-extension`** interface, discharged in
  `Schoenflies/JordanSchoenflies.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.square_reduction` — `prop:square-reduction`.
* `Schoenflies.closed_interior_extension` — **`thm:closed-interior-extension`**.
* `Schoenflies.pointed_extension` — `prop:pointed-extension`; it proves
  `Schoenflies.PointedInteriorExtension` of `Schoenflies/Inversion.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.exterior_extension_of_squareExtension` — `prop:exterior-extension`, restated
  with `harc` discharged and only `SquareExtension` left.
* `Schoenflies.jordan_schoenflies_of_squareExtension`,
  `Schoenflies.jordan_schoenflies_homeomorph_of_squareExtension`,
  `Schoenflies.jordan_schoenflies_of_homeomorph_of_squareExtension` — **`thm:main`**, the relative
  Jordan–Schönflies theorem, in the unbundled, the bundled, and the blueprint's own shape.

Supporting material with no blueprint statement, all general and all candidates for hoisting
into the module that owns `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn`:
`Schoenflies.exists_isHomeoOn_of_homeomorph`, `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn.homeomorphOfUniv`,
`Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn.image_inv_eq`, `Schoenflies.image_eq_diff_of_bijOn_union`,
`Schoenflies.paste` and `Schoenflies.Plane.IsSquareMover.isHomeoOn`.

/-! ### Restricted homeomorphisms: three general tools

`Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` (in `Schoenflies/Inversion.lean`) is the unbundled "restricts to a
homeomorphism of `S` onto `T`". Three facts about it are needed below and are not there; they
are general, and the section comment at `IsHomeoOn` already asks for the whole notion to be
hoisted, so these should travel with it. -/

/-- A `Homeomorph` between two subsets of the plane can always be presented as an
`IsHomeoOn` between honest self-maps of the plane: extend both by the identity.

This is the bridge from `lem:jordan-circle`, which produces `Nonempty (↥C ≃ₜ ↥S)`, to the
unbundled language everything downstream is written in. -/

The blueprint's `Q = [-1,1]²` is `Plane.closedSquare 0 1` and its boundary `S = ∂Q` is
`modelCurve`, by `modelCurve_eq_frontier`. One consequence is needed: removing the boundary
from the closed square leaves the open square, which is where `lem:square-point-mover` wants
its two points. -/

This is the one statement the module assumes, and the only thing standing between the library
and `thm:main`. It is the last big theorem of the manuscript; its proof occupies the whole of
Part II §§"Strongly accessible boundary points"–"Continuity at the Jordan curve". -/

/-- **`thm:square-extension` (square extension)**, as a hypothesis: for every Jordan curve `C`
and every homeomorphism `u : C → S` there is a homeomorphism `C ∪ Int(C) → Q` extending `u`.

Written in the unbundled `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` style: `u` comes with its inverse `v`, and the
conclusion produces the extension `F` together with its inverse `G`. `S` is
`Schoenflies.modelCurve` and `Q` is `Schoenflies.Plane.closedSquare 0 1`. -/

A curve is disjoint from either of its two regions, and adding it and removing it again is the
identity. The pastings below use these constantly. -/

`h` over the two closed discs by `thm:square-extension`, and take `Ψ⁻¹ ∘ Φ`. -/

/-- **`prop:square-reduction` (reduction to the square).** If every boundary homeomorphism from
a Jordan curve to `S` has a closed-interior extension, then every homeomorphism `f : C → C'`

/-! ### `prop:pointed-extension`

The blueprint's proof, with one step made explicit: the square chart `Θ` of the *target* disc
carries `Int(C')` onto `Q ∖ ∂Q = Q°`, because it carries `C'` onto `∂Q` and is a bijection of
the closed disc onto `Q`. That is what puts the two points `Θ(Φ(a))` and `Θ(b)` in the open
square, where `lem:square-point-mover` lives. -/

/-- **`prop:pointed-extension` (pointed closed-interior extension).** A boundary homeomorphism
`f : C → C'` and prescribed points `a ∈ Int(C)`, `b ∈ Int(C')` admit a closed-interior
extension `H` with `H(a) = b`.
