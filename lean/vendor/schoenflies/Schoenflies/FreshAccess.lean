# Access from a fresh anchor, for `thm:finite-transfer`(b)

Direction (b) of `thm:finite-transfer` transfers a target refinement back to the source. Every
step of its induction is the same as direction (a)'s except one: when the target ear starts at
a point of `S`, that point is by hypothesis a fresh image `u(a)` of an anchor `a ∈ 𝒜`, and the
*source* endpoint `a` lies on the wild curve `C`, where no polygonal skeleton reaches it and
`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility` says nothing. The blueprint's paragraph is:

> The union `K` of all old closed nonboundary edges and the finitely many source ears already
> inserted is compact and does not contain `a`. By `lem:tangent-cone`, a tangent disk at `a`
> contains an open cone of access segments. By `lem:compact-separation`(c), shrink that cone
> until it misses `K`. Its punctured part is connected, lies in the complement of the current
> skeleton, and accumulates at `a`; therefore it lies in the unique current source 2-cell just
> identified. It supplies the required access arc.

That paragraph is proved here, end to end, as `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_of_stronglyAccessible`.

## The three facts about the cone that the paragraph needs

`Schoenflies.accessCone` is on `main` (`Schoenflies/Accessible.lean`) with its openness, its
truncation, and `StronglyAccessible.exists_cone` — a cone of *any* radius below the radius of
the tangent disk lies in the domain, which is exactly the shrinking the paragraph performs.
What was missing is the three properties that make it usable as the connected set of
`lem:cellulation-invariants`(i):

* it is **convex**, hence preconnected (`convex_accessCone`, `isPreconnected_accessCone`) —
  the condition `‖x - p‖/2 < ⟪v, x - p⟫` is the superlevel set of a concave function and the
  truncation is a ball;
* the apex is in its **closure** (`mem_closure_accessCone`) — this is "accumulates at `a`",
  and it is what identifies the cell;
* it contains a straight **access segment** from the apex (`polyAccessible_accessCone`), which
  is `Schoenflies.PolyAccessible` in the shape `lem:accessible-endpoints` consumes.

Note that no *puncturing* is needed: `Schoenflies.notMem_accessCone` says the apex is not in the
cone to begin with, so the blueprint's "its punctured part" is the cone itself.

## Which 2-cell, and why that is a hypothesis

"Therefore it lies in the unique current source 2-cell just identified" has two halves. That the
cone lies in *some* 2-cell is proved here, from `Schoenflies.CellsAbsorb` — the same single
hypothesis `Schoenflies/SkeletonAccess.lean` carries, discharged by
`Schoenflies.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent` or `.cellsAbsorb_of_isComponent_in` — together with a
covering clause. That the cell is the *prescribed* one is the separate combinatorial paragraph
of the blueprint ("each of the resulting outer subedges is incident with exactly one source
2-cell … hence exactly one descendant 2-cell remains incident with `a`"), an induction over the
ear sequence, and it enters here as the hypothesis `hunique`: *the only cell whose closure
contains `a` is `F`*. That is a statement about the ear induction, not about the geometry of the
cone, and the induction is what will discharge it.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.convex_accessCone`, `Schoenflies.isPreconnected_accessCone`,
  `Schoenflies.mem_closure_accessCone`, `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_accessCone` — the three
  properties of the cone of `lem:tangent-cone` that `thm:finite-transfer`(b) uses.
* `Schoenflies.exists_accessCone_disjoint` — "by `lem:compact-separation`(c), shrink that cone
  until it misses `K`", combining `lem:tangent-cone` with `lem:compact-separation`(c).
* `Schoenflies.accessCone_subset_cell` — "its punctured part is connected, lies in the
  complement of the current skeleton, and accumulates at `a`; therefore it lies in the unique
  current source 2-cell", from `lem:cellulation-invariants`(i) in the `CellsAbsorb` reading.
* `Schoenflies.CellsAbsorbIn`, `Schoenflies.accessCone_subset_cell_in` — the domain-restricted
  form actually used in direction (b): the access cone already lies in the Jordan domain, so
  absorption is needed only for connected subsets of that domain.
* `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_of_stronglyAccessible` — the whole paragraph: a strongly
  accessible point of the wild curve is polygonally accessible from the current source 2-cell
  incident with it. This is the one input direction (b) needs beyond direction (a).
* `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_of_stronglyAccessible_in` — the same conclusion from the
  domain-restricted absorption interface.

`accessCone p v s` is cut out of the ball `B(p, s)` by `‖x - p‖/2 < ⟪v, x - p⟫`. Both halves
are convex — the second because `y ↦ ⟪v, y⟫ - ‖y‖/2` is concave — so the cone is, and in
particular it is connected, which is what `lem:cellulation-invariants`(i) asks of it. -/

the skeleton is in an open cell — and `habs` is the absorption half, `Schoenflies.CellsAbsorb`.

drawn, is polygonally accessible from the current source 2-cell `F` incident with it. Compare
`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`, which does the same job at every point *off* `C` and is
useless here precisely because `a ∈ C`.

`lem:accessible-endpoints` (`Schoenflies.exists_crosscut_of_polyAccessible`) turns this, together
