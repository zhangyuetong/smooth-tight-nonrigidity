# The skeleton homeomorphism across a 2-cell split

`Schoenflies/RealizeSplit.lean` builds **one** realization of `S.splitFace d` from a realization
`R` of `S` and a drawing of the ear as a polygonal crosscut. A *matched* cellulation is two
realizations of one abstract structure together with the skeleton homeomorphism between them
(`def:matched-pair` clause 3), so the split has to be performed on both sides at once and the
skeleton homeomorphism has to be carried across. That is what this module does.

## Blueprint

* `def:matched-pair`, clause 3 — the chosen homeomorphism `g : |Γ| → |Γ'|`, recorded as
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SkeletonHomeo`, extended across one split.
* `def:generated-structure`, operation 2 — the 2-cell split, whose two realizations are the
  output of `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.realize`.

## What is constructed

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.skeletonSet_realize` — **the split's realized 1-skeleton
  is the old one together with the drawn ear**, as a point set. Everything else rests on this.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.EarHomeo` — the chosen homeomorphism between the two
  drawn ears (see the next section).
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.EarHomeo.symm` — the same chosen matching with source
  and target reversed, used by finite-transfer direction (b).
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.splitMap` / `splitInvMap` — the transported map and its
  inverse, as plain functions `Plane → Plane`: `g` on the old skeleton, the ear map off it.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.splitHomeo` — the `SkeletonHomeo` between the two split
  realizations. A `def` with lemmas, not an `∃`-packaged bundle.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.splitHomeo_eqOn` — **the transported map agrees with `g`
  on the whole old skeleton.** This is exactly `Schoenflies.StageSequence.skelHomeo_succ` at a
  split step, and it is the reason the construction is "extend `g` by the ear map" rather than
  "rebuild a homeomorphism from scratch".

## How the ear map is presented, and why

Two shapes were available.

(a) **As data**: a map `Plane → Plane` (with an inverse) carrying the drawn source ear onto the
drawn target ear, vertex to corresponding vertex and edge arc to corresponding edge arc.

(b) **Built edge by edge** from the two `EarCrosscut`s, by composing one edge's parametrization
with the inverse of the other's.

This module takes **(a)**, as `EarHomeo`. The reason is the consumer, not the construction:
`def:matched-pair` clause 3 says that `g` *restricts to a fixed chosen homeomorphism* on each
corresponding pair of cells, so a caller assembling a matched pair is holding such a chosen
homeomorphism already — for the old cells it is `g` itself, and for the ear's cells it is
whatever the producer of the two crosscuts chose. Shape (b) would manufacture a second,
different homeomorphism from the two parametrizations, and the caller would then have to prove
that its own choice agrees with the manufactured one. It would also silently fix an orientation
of every ear edge: `Graph.IsDrawing.edge_param` is orientation-free, so `earDraw₁ f 0` and
`earDraw₂ f 0` need not be the ends that correspond, and (b) would need the `SubdivData.leftParam`
trick of `Schoenflies/RealizeSubdiv.lean` replayed per edge.

Every field of `EarHomeo` is therefore something the caller supplies, and none of them mentions
`R₁`, `R₂` or `g`: the ear map is a statement about the two drawn ears alone. In particular
**no compatibility hypothesis between `m` and `g` is asked for**, because none is needed: at the
ear's two ends `m.toFun` and `g.toFun` are *forced* to agree, both being pinned to
`R₂.pos d.source` and `R₂.pos d.target` — `m` by `earPos_apply` together with the two `pos_source`
/ `pos_target` clauses of the two `EarCrosscut`s, and `g` by its own `pos_apply`. That is
`EarHomeo.toFun_pos_source` / `toFun_pos_target` below.

## The proof, in one paragraph

The new skeleton is a union of two **closed** sets — the old realized skeleton
(`Realization.isCompact_skeletonSet`) and the drawn ear, which is an arc
(`EarCrosscut.isArcBetween_earSet`) and hence compact. Continuity of the transported map is the
pasting lemma `Schoenflies.Plane.continuousOn_union_of_isClosed` on those two pieces; the two
pieces meet exactly in the ear's two ends (`EarCrosscut.earSet_inter_skeletonSet`, which is
`SplitData.vertexSet_inter` made geometric), and there the two prescriptions agree. Injectivity
and the two inverse laws are injectivity on each piece plus the fact that the *images* also meet
only in the two images of the ends — for which the target-side
`EarCrosscut.earSet_inter_skeletonSet` is again what is spent. `pos_apply` and `edgeArc_image`
split into the old cells, where `g`'s own fields serve verbatim, and the ear's cells, where
`EarHomeo`'s two matching clauses are the statement.

## What is *not* here

The **subdivision** analogue — the transported skeleton homeomorphism across an edge
subdivision — is deliberately absent. It is being built concurrently on branch
`wt/arc-monotone`, where the missing ingredient (a homeomorphism between two arcs fixing their
ends is monotone, hence carries initial subarcs to initial subarcs — see the section
"What is *not* here" of `Schoenflies/RealizeSubdiv.lean`) is the actual content. Nothing below
depends on it, and nothing below should be duplicated there: this module is the split case only.

## The general lemma this needed

`Graph.pointSet_congr` — the point set of a plane graph depends on the drawing only through the
arcs of the graph's own edges. It is stated in the root `Graph` namespace next to
`Graph.pointSet_union` (which lives in `Schoenflies/FaceCycles.lean`); if a second consumer
appears it belongs there or in `Schoenflies/Graph/Drawing.lean`.

This is `def:matched-pair` clause 3 restricted to the cells the split creates: a homeomorphism
between the two drawn ears which matches corresponding vertices and corresponding edges. It is
data, not a proposition, and it mentions neither realization: everything it says is a statement
about the two drawings of `d.ear`.

`earPos_apply` and `edgeArc_image` are the two matching clauses. Together they force
`toFun '' (source ear) = (target ear)` (`EarHomeo.image_earSet`), which is why no separate
surjectivity clause is asked for. The inverse is supplied as data, exactly as in
`CellStructure.SkeletonHomeo`, so that no compactness argument is needed to speak of a
homeomorphism. -/

/-- **The transported map agrees with `g` on the whole old realized skeleton.**

This is the field `Schoenflies.StageSequence.skelHomeo_succ` at a 2-cell split step: consecutive
skeleton maps agree wherever both are defined. It holds by definition, which is the point of
building the map by extension rather than by rebuilding. -/
