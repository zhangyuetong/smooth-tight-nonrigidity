# Joining accessible boundary points

Two boundary points of a region that are each reachable by a polygonal arc from inside can be
joined by a *single* simple polygonal arc whose interior stays inside the region. This is
`lem:accessible-endpoints`, and the same extraction — applied to a finite polygonal skeleton
rather than to a pair of access arcs — is `lem:skeleton-crosscuts`.

## The predicate

`Schoenflies.PolyAccessible Ω a` says that `a` admits a *polygonal access arc* from `Ω`: a
vertex list starting at `a`, ending inside `Ω`, all of whose points other than `a` lie in `Ω`.

The definition deliberately does **not** ask the access arc to be simple. A consumer that has
only a self-crossing approach path can still supply the hypothesis, and nothing is lost: the
extraction below re-runs `lem:finite-polygonal-union` on the whole union anyway, so simplicity
of the input is never used. `PolyAccessible.exists_simple` recovers the blueprint's literal
phrasing (*a simple polygonal arc from `a` to a point of `Ω`*) for a point off `Ω`, so the two
readings agree where the blueprint uses them.

Note also that neither the definition nor the theorems below mention `frontier Ω`. The
blueprint states `lem:accessible-endpoints` for `a, b ∈ ∂Ω`, but boundary membership plays no
role in the proof — only `a ≠ b` does — so the statements here are the stronger ones with the
hypothesis dropped. A consumer holding `a, b ∈ ∂Ω` simply does not pass it.

## The method, and where the difficulty actually is

Take an access arc from `a` and one from `b`, join their far ends inside `Ω` by
`lem:polygonal-connected` (`Schoenflies.exists_poly_of_isPreconnected`), and extract a simple
arc from the resulting three-piece polygonal union by `lem:finite-polygonal-union`
(`Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_union`).

The whole content is that the extraction must keep the two endpoints and must keep everything
else inside `Ω`. Both are free from the interface actually on `main`:
`Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_union` already returns a vertex list whose `head` is `a` and
whose `getLast` is `b`, together with `IsArcBetween _ a b`, so the endpoints are pinned; and it
returns the arc as a *subset of the union it was extracted from*, so `poly ws \ {a, b} ⊆ Ω`
follows from the same inclusion for the union. No endpoint-pinning lemma had to be added.

What *was* missing is a version of the extraction indexed by an arbitrary finite family rather
than by a `List (Set Plane)`: a skeleton arrives as a finite set of edges, and turning it into a
list at the call site is noise. `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_biUnion_finite` is that
version and belongs beside `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_union` in
`Schoenflies/SimpleArc.lean`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.PolyAccessible` — "admitting a polygonal access arc from `Ω`", the hypothesis of
  `lem:accessible-endpoints`.
* `Schoenflies.PolyAccessible.of_openSegment`, `Schoenflies.StronglyAccessible.polyAccessible`,
  `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_of_poly`, `Schoenflies.polyAccessible_of_poly'` — the ways the
  construction produces the hypothesis: a straight access segment, Definition 8.1 (strong
  accessibility), and a chain already known to run into `Ω` from either of its ends.
* `Schoenflies.PolyAccessible.exists_simple` — the blueprint's literal reading of the
  hypothesis, for a point off `Ω`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_biUnion_finite`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_simple_arc_of_biUnion_finite`, `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_pinned`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_isPolygonal_pinned` — `lem:finite-polygonal-union` over a
  finite family, and with the "off the endpoints, stay in the region" clause attached. These
  four belong in `Schoenflies/SimpleArc.lean`.
* `Graph.pointSet_eq_biUnion`, `Graph.exists_simple_poly_of_pointSet` — the same extraction on
  the point set of a finite plane graph with polygonal edges, which is the shape a skeleton
  stage arrives in. Root `Graph` namespace, per the convention of `Schoenflies/Graph/*`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_polyAccessible`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_simple_arc_of_polyAccessible` — `lem:accessible-endpoints`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_crosscut_of_polyAccessible` — `lem:accessible-endpoints` in crosscut form:
  when `Ω` misses a set `C` carrying `a` and `b`, the arc meets `C` exactly at its endpoints.
* `Schoenflies.exists_crosscut_of_biUnion_finite`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_crosscut_arc_of_biUnion_finite` — `lem:skeleton-crosscuts`, the extraction
  step: a connected finite polygonal union meeting `C` in exactly two points carries a simple
  polygonal crosscut between them.

`lem:skeleton-crosscuts` has two further halves that are **not** here, because the objects they
speak about are not yet in Lean: the construction of the connected union `Y = e_a ∪ |Λ| ∪ e_b`
from a finite stage of the skeleton, and the transport of the crosscut through the finite
skeleton homeomorphism. Both need the stage/anchor machinery of §"Continuity at the Jordan
curve"; the extraction between them is what this module supplies.

The last clause is the one the consumers of `lem:accessible-endpoints` and
`lem:skeleton-crosscuts` actually use, with `E = {a, b}` the two endpoints and `S` the region:
the extracted arc must keep its endpoints *and* keep everything else inside the region. It is a
one-line consequence of the arc being a subset of the union, but stating it here means no
consumer has to rediscover that the extraction is inclusion-preserving. -/

/-! ### `lem:skeleton-crosscuts`: the extraction step

The blueprint's proof of `lem:skeleton-crosscuts` builds, from a finite stage of the skeleton, a
connected finite union `Y = e_a ∪ |Λ| ∪ e_b` of polygonal arcs with `Y ∩ C = {a, b}`, and then
says: *subdivide `Y` at its finitely many vertices; the resulting finite graph is connected, so
it contains a simple graph path `P` from `a` to `b`, as in the proof of
`lem:finite-polygonal-union`; this path meets `C` only at its endpoints and is therefore a
polygonal crosscut.* That last step is what this paragraph is. The construction of `Y` from the
skeleton needs the stage machinery and is not here. -/

/-- **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts`, extraction step.** A connected finite union of polygonal sets
which meets `C` in exactly the two distinct points `a, b` carries a simple polygonal arc from
`a` to `b` meeting `C` only at its endpoints — a polygonal crosscut.

The last conclusion, `poly ws \ {a, b} ⊆ D`, is the crosscut condition relative to a region `D`
containing the part of the union off `C`; for `D = Cᶜ` it is automatic, and the skeleton
consumer instantiates it with the interior of the Jordan curve. -/

/-! ### The extraction on the point set of a finite polygonal plane graph

set. Splitting that into "one singleton per vertex, one arc per edge" is the only step between
