# The outer face of a chain of plane graphs

`lem:outer-chain`. Let `Γ 0, …, Γ n` (`n ≥ 2`, so at least three graphs) be finite 2-connected
polygonal plane graphs, consecutive ones sharing at least two vertices and nonconsecutive ones
disjoint. If a point `x` is in the outer face of every consecutive pair `Γ p ∪ Γ (p+1)`, then it
is in the outer face of `Γ 0 ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ n`.

## How the chain is formalised

The blueprint says "after subdividing common points into vertices". Here that is true by
construction rather than by a theorem: the family shares **one** ambient edge type `β` and
**one** drawing `drawing : β → ℝ → Plane`, and every member is a subgraph of a single plane
graph `G` — see `Graph.IsPlaneChain`. Two members therefore agree about the ends of a shared
edge, meet only where `G` lets them meet, and `Γ p ∪ Γ q` is `Graph.union` with nothing to
check. The ambient `G` is allowed to be larger than the chain's own union; a consumer that has
built all its pieces inside one polygonal overlay hands that overlay over as `G`.

`Graph.chainUnion Γ i m` is the block `Γ i ∪ Γ (i+1) ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ (i+m)`, indexed by its **length**
`m` rather than by its right endpoint, so that the recursion is on `m` and the blueprint's
"choose `i ≤ j` with `j - i` minimum" is a plain strong induction on `m`. A consecutive pair is
`chainUnion Γ p 1`.

"`x` is in the outer face of `H`" is spelled, as everywhere in this development, as *`x` is off
the drawing and the face through it is unbounded* — `x ∈ exterior H drawing` together with
`¬ Bornology.IsBounded (face H drawing x)`. `Graph.unbounded_face_unique` is what makes that
"the" outer face, and `Graph.beyondSquare_subset_face` is how a consumer proves it.

## What is proved and what is assumed

The blueprint's proof is a minimal-counterexample argument on two measures: first the length of
the index interval, then the number of edges of the enclosing cycle lying outside `Γ (j-1)`.
Both minimisations are carried out here, as strong inductions, together with

* the reduction of "`x` lies in a bounded face" to "some cycle encloses `x`"
  (`Graph.encloses_of_isBounded_face`, from `Graph.face_cycles'`) and back
  (`Graph.isBounded_face_of_encloses`);
* 2-connectivity of every block, by iterating `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union`
  (`lem:union-two-connected`);
* the base case `j - i ≤ 1`, which is the blueprint's paragraph "If `j-i ≤ 1`, choose a
  consecutive pair `H` containing that union …";
* the two minimality consequences "`C` contains an edge of `Γ j` outside `Γ (j-1)`" and "`C`
  contains an edge of the earlier chain outside `Γ (j-1)`", each proved by pushing the cycle
  down into a shorter block with `Graph.IsCycleThrough.anti`;
* the splicing of a crosscut onto each of the two arcs (`Graph.exists_spliced_cycles`, from
  `Graph.exists_spliced_cycle`) and the edge count that makes the splice a strict improvement
  (`Graph.edgesOutside_splice_lt`, `Graph.exists_cycle_edgesOutside_lt`).

`Graph.Descent` is the middle paragraph of the blueprint's proof — from a cycle `C` of
`Γ i ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ j` enclosing `x` and having an edge of `Γ j` and an edge of `Γ i ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ (j-2)`
outside `Γ (j-1)`, produce a cycle of the same block enclosing `x` with strictly fewer edges
outside `Γ (j-1)`. It is a statement about **one** step, not about the chain's outer face.

It was assumed when this module was written. Both halves are now proved:

* `Schoenflies/CrosscutExists.lean` — combinatorial: build the crosscut, as
  `Graph.IsPlaneChain.crosscutExists`. Nothing geometric enters beyond
  `Graph.IsPlaneChain.disjoint_block_far`, "`Γ j` meets the earlier chain only through
  `Γ (j-1)`".
* `Schoenflies/CrosscutEncloses.lean` — geometric: "the path `R` lies on one side of `C` and is
  a crosscut there; by `thm:polygonal-crosscut`, at least one of `R ∪ C₁`, `R ∪ C₂` encloses
  `x`", as `Graph.crosscutEnclosesOff`. That module also carries the counterexample showing why
  the clause `x ∈ exterior H drawing` cannot be dropped — see the comment below, where the false
  version of it used to stand.

`Schoenflies/OuterChainClosed.lean` combines the two, and states `lem:outer-chain` with nothing
assumed.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.chainUnion` — `Γ i ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ (i+m)`, with `chainUnion_le`, `le_chainUnion`,
  `chainUnion_finite`, `chainUnion_isTwoConnected` (the last is repeated
  `lem:union-two-connected`).
* `Graph.Encloses` — "that face is the interior of its boundary cycle, which therefore encloses
  `x`", as a property of a graph.
* `Graph.encloses_of_isBounded_face`, `Graph.isBounded_face_of_encloses` — the two directions
  of that reduction; the second is the blueprint's "the face of `H` containing `x` … lies in the
  bounded set `Int(C)` and therefore is not the outer face of `H`".
* `Graph.IsPlaneChain` — the hypotheses of `lem:outer-chain`; `Graph.OuterOnPairs` — its
  hypothesis on consecutive pairs.
* `Graph.IsCycleCrosscut` — the crosscut `R` of the cycle `C`, with the two arcs it cuts.
* `Graph.exists_spliced_cycles` — the two cycles `R ∪ C₁`, `R ∪ C₂`.
* `Graph.edgesOutside`, `Graph.edgesOutside_splice_lt`,
  `Graph.exists_cycle_edgesOutside_lt` — "it has fewer edges outside `Γ (j-1)` than `C`, since
  one nonempty outside portion of `C` has been replaced by `R ⊆ Γ (j-1)`".
* `Graph.Descent` — the crosscut paragraph of the proof; discharged in
  `Schoenflies/CrosscutEncloses.lean` from `Graph.CrosscutExists` alone.
* `Graph.IsPlaneChain.not_encloses` — the double minimisation.
* `Graph.IsPlaneChain.outer_chain` — **`lem:outer-chain`**, from `Graph.Descent`;
  `Graph.IsPlaneChain.outer_chain'` in `Schoenflies/OuterChainClosed.lean` is the same
  statement with nothing assumed.

/-! ### A crosscut of a cycle, with the two arcs it cuts

This is the combinatorial output of the blueprint's crosscut paragraph, bundled: the path `R` in
`F = Γ (j-1)`, its two endpoints `a, b` on the cycle, and the two arcs `D₁, D₂` the endpoints cut
the cycle into. Both arcs are required to carry an edge that `F` does not have — the blueprint's
"each arc contains an edge outside `Γ (j-1)`, because its endpoints belong to different maximal
subpaths of the intersection" — which is what makes the splice a strict improvement on **both**
sides, so that it does not matter which of the two spliced cycles turns out to enclose `x`. -/

/-- **A crosscut of a cycle.** `R` is a path of `H` between two vertices `a ≠ b` of the cycle
`e :: D`, lying in `F`, using no edge of the cycle and no vertex of it internally; `D₁, D₂` are
the two arcs the cycle splits into, each carrying an edge outside `F`. -/

/-! ### The assumed step

Everything in the blueprint's proof except this one paragraph is discharged below. -/

/-- **The crosscut step of `lem:outer-chain`, assumed.**

Given a cycle `C` of the block `Γ i ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ (i+m+2)` that encloses `x`, which has an edge of the
last member `Γ (i+m+2)` outside `Γ (i+m+1)` *and* an edge of the earlier chain
`Γ i ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ (i+m)` outside `Γ (i+m+1)`, there is a cycle of the same block that encloses `x`
and has strictly fewer edges outside `Γ (i+m+1)`.

This is the blueprint's paragraph beginning "Minimality of the interval implies that `C`
contains an edge of `Γ j` outside `Γ (j-1)`": choose points `a, b` in the interiors of the two
edges; each of the two arcs of `C` from `a` to `b` must meet `Γ (j-1)`, because `Γ j` meets the
earlier chain only through `Γ (j-1)`; take the two maximal subpaths of `C ∩ Γ (j-1)` they
contain and a minimum-length path `R` in `Γ (j-1)` from one to the other; `R` is a crosscut of
the side of `C` it lies in, and `thm:polygonal-crosscut` says exactly one of `R ∪ C₁`, `R ∪ C₂`
encloses `x`. That cycle stays in the block, and one nonempty outside portion of `C` has been
replaced by `R ⊆ Γ (j-1)`.

It is a statement about a single descent step, not about outer faces, and it does not mention
`n` except to keep the block inside the chain. A discharging module has
`Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at`, `Graph.exists_spliced_cycle`, `Graph.IsDrawing.arcs_of_split`
and `Schoenflies.crosscutSplitsRegion` available. -/

/-! ### `Descent`, split into a combinatorial and a geometric half

`Graph.Descent` is what the main theorem consumes, and `Graph.descent_of_crosscut` derives it
from the two halves below, doing the splicing and the edge count in between. A module wishing to
discharge `Descent` may therefore prove these two instead, which is the natural division of
labour: `CrosscutExists` is a statement about walks in graphs with no geometry in it beyond the
disjointness of nonconsecutive members, and `CrosscutEncloses` is a statement about **one**
plane graph, **one** cycle and **one** crosscut, with no chain in it at all. -/

/-- **The combinatorial half of the descent step.** The blueprint's "choose points `a, b` in the
relative interiors of these two edges … each of those two arcs must meet `Γ (j-1)` … choose such
a path `R` of minimum length": from a cycle of the block enclosing `x` with an edge of the last
member and an edge of the earlier chain outside `Γ (j-1)`, build a crosscut of that cycle inside
`Γ (j-1)`.

The hypothesis that `x` is enclosed is carried along because it costs nothing and a discharger
may want it; the construction in the blueprint does not use it. -/
def CrosscutExists (Γ : ℕ → Graph Plane β) (drawing : β → ℝ → Plane) (n : ℕ) (x : Plane) :
    Prop :=
  ∀ (i m : ℕ), i + (m + 2) ≤ n →
    ∀ (e : β) (u v : Plane) (D : List β),
      (chainUnion Γ i (m + 2)).IsCycleThrough e u v D →
      x ∈ inside (edgesCover drawing (e :: D)) →
      (∃ g ∈ e :: D, g ∈ E(Γ (i + m + 2)) ∧ g ∉ E(Γ (i + m + 1))) →
      (∃ g ∈ e :: D, g ∈ E(chainUnion Γ i m) ∧ g ∉ E(Γ (i + m + 1))) →
      ∃ (a b : Plane) (R D₁ D₂ : List β),
        IsCycleCrosscut (chainUnion Γ i (m + 2)) (Γ (i + m + 1)) e u v D a b R D₁ D₂

/- The geometric half of the descent step **used to be stated here**, as `CrosscutEncloses`:
the same statement as `Graph.CrosscutEnclosesOff` in `Schoenflies/CrosscutEncloses.lean` but
without the clause `x ∈ exterior H drawing`. In that form it is FALSE, and it stood here as an
assumed hypothesis for a whole wave before anyone tried to prove it.

Nothing in its hypotheses stopped the crosscut from being drawn *through* `x`. Take the unit
square cycle with cut points `(0,0)` and `(1,1)`, let `R` be the two straight edges
`(0,0) → (1/2,1/2) → (1,1)` through a fresh vertex, and let `x = (2/5, 2/5)`. Every field of
`IsCycleCrosscut` holds and `x ∈ inside (edgesCover drawing (e :: D))`; but `x` lies *on* both
spliced curves, and `Schoenflies.mem_inside_iff` puts a point of a curve inside neither region.

The repair costs the consumer nothing, because `Graph.OuterOnPairs` already places `x` off the
whole chain: `Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscutOff` proves `Graph.Descent` below verbatim,
supplying the missing clause from `hout`. This is what the standing rule about naming a missing
result as an explicit hypothesis buys — the defect surfaced at the discharger, with a
counterexample, instead of as a `sorry` nobody revisited. -/

/-- The hypothesis of `lem:outer-chain` on consecutive pairs: `x` is in the outer face of every
`Γ p ∪ Γ (p+1)` — off its drawing, with an unbounded face through it. A consumer proves the
second clause with `Graph.beyondSquare_subset_face`, and `Graph.unbounded_face_unique` is what
makes "an unbounded face" *the* outer face. -/
