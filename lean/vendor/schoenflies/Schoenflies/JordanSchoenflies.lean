# The Jordan–Schönflies theorem

The quantitative stage recursion supplies the interior homeomorphism.  Its fresh target nets
give a dense source anchor set; radial mesh spokes supply the boundary germs, and finite-stage
nonboundary edge paths supply matched crosscuts. These data prove `HasLimitHomeomorphism`, then
`SquareExtension`, and finally the relative Jordan–Schönflies theorem.

## Blueprint

The declarations below close `thm:square-extension` and `thm:main`; the intervening square
reduction, closed-interior, pointed, and exterior extensions are supplied by `Endgame.lean`.
