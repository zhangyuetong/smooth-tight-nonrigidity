# Catching a bounded set inside a square

The outer face of a plane graph is found by catching the whole drawing — finitely many points
and finitely many compact arcs — inside one axis-parallel square, and then observing that the
outside of that square is connected (`isConnected_beyondSquare`) and therefore lies in a single
face. This module is the "catching" half.

The key identity is `beyondSquare_eq_compl`: the outside of a square, as defined by a
coordinate inequality, *is* the complement of the closed square. It is what lets the
connectedness theorem be applied to a complement.

## Blueprint

* `beyondSquare_eq_compl` — the outside of a square is the complement of the closed square.
* `exists_closedSquare_of_isBounded`, `IsCompact.exists_closedSquare` — a bounded set is caught
  inside a square about the origin.
* `isOpen_compl_of_finite_isCompact` — the complement of a finite union of compact sets is
  open; the exterior of a plane graph is open for this reason.
