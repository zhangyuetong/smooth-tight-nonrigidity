# Attaching a local source grid — `prop:local-grid-attachment`

`Schoenflies/LocalGrid.lean` built the grid `K` itself and its quantitative clause 3. This
module is the *rest* of the proposition: the overlay of `K` with the polygonal nonboundary
skeleton of `Γ`, the three cases of the union argument, and the component-joining loop.

## Blueprint

* `lem:polygonal-overlay`, with the convention of `rem:polygonal-overlay-convention` —
  `Schoenflies.attachPoints`, `Schoenflies.attachGraph`, `Schoenflies.attachGraph_isDrawing`,
  `Schoenflies.attachGraph_pointSet`.
* `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` — `Graph.SameLinks` and
  `Schoenflies.overlayGraph_isTwoConnected`, the bridge that lets the raw-subdivision
  2-connectivity of `Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` reach an overlay graph at all (see the
  next section); `Schoenflies.pieceListGraph_append_crosscut`, the single-ear step.
* `lem:union-two-connected` — `Schoenflies.overlayGraph_append_isTwoConnected` and
  `Schoenflies.attachGraph_isTwoConnected`, the blueprint's three cases in one statement.
* the auxiliary crosscut `E` of the two degenerate cases — `Schoenflies.exists_crosscut`,
  `Schoenflies.frontier_face_subset_pointSet`, `Schoenflies.seg_subset_crosscut`
  ("since `E` contains `J`") and `Schoenflies.two_common_of_crosscut`.
* the component-joining loop — `Schoenflies.isConnected_union_joins` and its cover form
  `Schoenflies.isConnected_cover_diff_of_joins`.
* `prop:local-grid-attachment` itself — `Schoenflies.gridAttachPieces`,
  `Schoenflies.gridAttachGraph`, with clause 1 `gridAttachGraph_isConnected_diff`, clause 2
  `localGrid_subset_gridAttachGraph`, clause 3 `attachGraph_localGridCell_diam`, and
  2-connectivity `gridAttachGraph_isTwoConnected`.

## The bridge that was missing: 2-connectivity of an overlay graph

`Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` proves `pieceListGraph_subdivide_isTwoConnected`: the graph
of a **raw** subdivided piece list is 2-connected. `Schoenflies/OverlayGraph.lean` builds the
overlay as `overlayGraph pieces points`, whose edges are the subdivided pieces *oriented and
deduplicated*. Nothing on `main` connects the two, so no overlay graph anywhere in the
development was known to be 2-connected — including `Schoenflies.squareMesh`, whose clause 5
is the subject of the first half of `LocalGrid.lean`.

Orienting renames an edge `(a, b)` to `(b, a)` and deduplication drops repeats, so the two
graphs are not equal and are not isomorphic by an identity on edges. But 2-connectivity does
not see edge *names*: it is a statement about which pairs of vertices are joined. That is what
`Graph.SameLinks` isolates — same vertex set, same joined pairs — and it transfers `Connected`,
`deleteVerts`, and hence `IsTwoConnected` in both directions.

## What is a hypothesis here, and why

Three things the blueprint's proof uses are hypotheses of the assembled theorems rather than
lemmas of this module, and all three are statements about `Γ`, never about the grid.

* `hΓ` of `gridAttachGraph_isTwoConnected` — the skeleton of `Γ`, with the case's crosscut and
  the loop's joining arcs appended and everything subdivided at the crossing points, is still
  2-connected. `Γ` itself is 2-connected by hypothesis of the proposition; the subdivision is
  `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (a), which is `pieceListGraph_subdivide_isTwoConnected` for the
  polygonal part and `Graph.IsTwoConnected.replace_edge_by_path` for the arcs of `C`; the ears
  are `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b), which is `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear`, and
  `pieceListGraph_append_crosscut` is that step for one straight crosscut. It is not proved here
  because this module never sees `Γ`'s drawing — `C` is not drawn by segments, so `Γ` is not a
  `pieceListGraph` and the union argument has to stay combinatorial.
* `hcov` of `gridAttachGraph_isConnected_diff` — that finitely many representatives meet every
  component of `|L| ∖ C`. This is the blueprint's *"since there are only finitely many
  components"*, and it is where the loop's termination lives. Nothing on `main` proves finiteness
  of a component count for a plane set.
* the joining arcs themselves — supplied to `gridAttachGraph_isConnected_diff` as the family
  `Jarc`, with the four properties `lem:polygonal-connected` gives them
  (`Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_isPreconnected` in `Schoenflies/PolygonalCarrier.lean`
  produces a polygonal path inside the open connected `D`, and `D ∩ C = ∅` gives `hJC`).


Neither is a restatement of a goal of this module, and both are true.

/-! ## Graphs that join the same pairs

2-connectivity is invariant under renaming edges, merging parallel edges, and dropping an edge
that duplicates another — none of which a `Graph` isomorphism captures, since the edge type is
fixed. `SameLinks` is the equivalence that does capture them, and it is exactly what the
overlay's orient-and-dedup step needs.

This is general graph theory and belongs in `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean` beside `IsWalk.mono`;
it is here only because it was needed here first. -/

`overlayGraph pieces points` and `pieceListGraph (overlayPieces pieces points)` are the same
structure with the same fields, so the equation is `rfl`. Saying it once lets every lemma of
`Schoenflies/SquareMeshConnected.lean` about `pieceListGraph` — in particular
`pieceListGraph_union`, which turns "glue on another family of segments" into a list append —
apply to overlays. -/

outer face — is stated for `overlayGraph`. -/

/-! ## Subdividing an append

The blueprint's `Γ ∪ K` is, at the level of segment lists, a list append, and
`pieceListGraph_union` turns the graph union into that append. Subdivision has to commute with
it, which it does because a subdivision is a `flatMap`. -/

/-! ### A cut point on the drawing is a vertex

`Schoenflies/SimpleArc.lean` proves this for `overlayGraph`; the union argument runs on the raw
subdivision, where the same two facts — `subdivide_cover` and `subdivide_avoids` — give it. -/

/-! ## The union: the case "at least two common vertices"

`lem:union-two-connected`, in the form `prop:local-grid-attachment` uses it. The two families of
segments are overlaid together — one list append, one list of cut points — and the two distinct
common points are supplied as points that lie on *both* families and are cut. -/

/-- **`prop:local-grid-attachment`, the main case.** Two families of segments, each of which is
2-connected after subdivision, overlay to a 2-connected graph as soon as two distinct cut points
lie on both families.

This is `lem:union-two-connected` composed with `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` and with the
orient-and-dedup bridge: the conclusion is about `overlayGraph`, which is what the plane layer
(drawing, faces, outer face) is stated for. -/

/-! ## The crosscut of a face

The two degenerate cases of `prop:local-grid-attachment` — no common vertex, and exactly one —
both build an auxiliary crosscut `E` of a face `F` of `Γ`: *"the component of `ℓ ∩ F` containing
the relative interior of `J` is a bounded open interval in `ℓ`; its closure `E` is a line segment
with two distinct endpoints on `∂F` and interior in `F`. Hence `E` is an ear for `Γ`."*

`Schoenflies.Plane.exists_openSegment_eq_connectedComponentIn` is exactly that component, with
its two endpoints already placed on `frontier F`. What is added here is the clause the blueprint
needs next — *"since `E` contains `J`"* — in the form that makes it usable: **every** connected
piece of `ℓ ∩ F` through the chosen point is swallowed by the crosscut, because a connected
subset of a set lies inside one component of it. -/

variable {F : Set Plane} {a b y : Plane}

/-- **The crosscut of a face along a line.** A face `F` (open, bounded) met by a line `ℓ` at `y`
supplies a segment `[q₀, q₁]` with distinct ends on `∂F`, open part inside `F`, containing `y` —
and containing every connected subset of `ℓ ∩ F` through `y`, which is how the blueprint's chosen
grid edge `J` ends up inside the crosscut. -/

/-! ## Attaching the crosscut as an ear

`lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (b) with the ear a single straight edge: once the crosscut's two

segment joining them is a path graph of length one. -/

/-! ## The component-joining loop

*"If `|L| ∖ C` has more than one component, choose points in two of its components and join them
by a simple polygonal arc in `D` … Each round therefore strictly decreases the number of
components. Since there are only finitely many components, finitely many repetitions produce a
2-connected graph `H_n` for which `|H_n| ∖ C` is connected."*

Counting components and decrementing is one way to run that loop; picking one representative per
component and joining each to a fixed one is another, and it is the one that survives
formalisation, because it replaces "strictly decreases" by a single induction-free statement. The
finiteness the blueprint spends is what supplies the finite list `reps`. -/

/-- **The joining loop.** If every point of `A` is joined inside `A` to one of finitely many
representatives, and each representative is joined to a fixed `r₀ ∈ A` by a connected set `T r`,
then `A` together with all the `T r` is connected.

The `T r` are the blueprint's joining arcs; nothing is assumed about how they meet `A` beyond
containing their two ends, so an arc that crosses `A` many times is no harder than one that does
not. -/

`prop:local-grid-attachment` is an existence statement, but its consumer —
`thm:finite-transfer`(a) — reads the graph, its drawing and its 2-connectivity by name. So the
graph is a `def` and every clause is a theorem about it. -/

/-- Cut points for a family of segments, together with prescribed extra points that are to
become vertices whatever else happens. Enlarging the list produced by `exists_cut_points` is

/-! ### Clause 1: the open nonboundary part is connected

The joining loop, transported from sets to the graph. What the graph occupies is
`cover pieces` (`attachGraph_pointSet`), so the whole statement is about covers. -/

/-- **`prop:local-grid-attachment` clause 1.** Adding to a family of segments the joining arcs
of the loop makes what it occupies, minus `C`, connected. Each joining arc must miss `C` — the
blueprint's *"because the joining arc lies in `D`"* — and that is the only thing asked of it. -/

/-! ### From the crosscut to two common vertices

*"Since `E` contains `J`, after subdivision `Γ ∪ E` and `K` have at least two common
vertices."* — the step that turns each degenerate case into the main one. Its content is the
swallowing clause of `exists_crosscut`: the grid edge's relative interior is a connected subset
of `ℓ ∩ F` through the chosen point, hence lies inside the crosscut's open part, hence the whole
closed grid edge lies inside the closed crosscut. -/

/-- **The crosscut contains the chosen grid edge.** -/

/-- **The degenerate cases, reduced to the main one.** With the crosscut `(q₀, q₁)` appended to
the `Γ`-side family, the two ends of the chosen grid edge `J` are two distinct points lying on
both families — which is exactly what `attachGraph_isTwoConnected` asks for.

Note what is *not* assumed: nothing about how many vertices `Γ` and `K` had in common. The case
split of the blueprint is a device for choosing `J` and the line `ℓ`; once they are chosen, the
three cases run the same argument. -/
