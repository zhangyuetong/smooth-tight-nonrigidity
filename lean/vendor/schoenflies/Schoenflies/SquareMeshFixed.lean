# The anchored square mesh: the three gaps an audit found

`Schoenflies/SquareMesh.lean` and `Schoenflies/SquareMeshConnected.lean` deliver
`prop:anchored-square-mesh` between them. An adversarial audit of the second found three real
gaps; this module closes what can be closed and states, as explicit hypotheses, what cannot.

## Gap 3 — the dropped subdivision step

The blueprint proves the inner grid 2-connected "by the same ear construction used for `K`,
together with `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve`". `SquareMeshConnected.gridGraph_isTwoConnected`
supplies the ear half (as a chain of `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union`s) and **drops the
subdivision half entirely** — yet the mesh subdivides the grid, at the four corners of the
inner square, at every point `λ zᵢ`, and at every crossing the overlay finds. A grid that is
2-connected before subdivision and unproved after it is of no use to the proposition.

`pieceListGraph_subdivide_isTwoConnected` is the missing half, in the vocabulary of
`Schoenflies/Subdivide.lean`: subdividing a list of segments whose graph is 2-connected, at
any list of points that cut it *cleanly* (`CleanCut`: each point interior to at most one
segment, and interior to none once it is an end of one), leaves the graph 2-connected. It is
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.replace_edge_by_path` — `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` (a) — iterated,
with the two-edge replacement path built by `isPathGraph_pair`.

For a grid the cleanliness hypothesis is **free**: two distinct grid edges meet only at a grid
point, and a grid point interior to a grid edge does not exist. So
`gridGraph_subdivide_isTwoConnected` has no hypothesis on the points at all.

## Gap 2 — the outer cycle was instantiated at the wrong square

`SquareMeshConnected.edgesCover_gridBoundary_modelCurve` pins the grid to `xc 0 = -1`,
`xc m = 1`, `yc 0 = -1`, `yc n = 1`: a grid spanning **all** of `Q`, whose boundary cycle is
`S`. The audit says such a grid cannot be the mesh, and it is right. The obstruction is
`gridGraph_full_square_aligned_ends` below: for `0 < i < m` the two grid points `(xc i, -1)`
and `(xc i, 1)` both lie on `S` and both carry an internal edge — the vertical edges at the
bottom and top of the column `i` — neither of which lies on `S`. Clause 3 of the proposition
then demands that *both* be fresh points of `u(𝒜)`, and clause 2 demands a grid line through
every old boundary vertex, which manufactures such a pair on the opposite side. Nothing about
`u(𝒜)` supplies pairs of points with a common coordinate: it is merely dense. The theorem is
true; the *instantiation* is wrong.

The blueprint's grid fills the **inner** square `λQ`, `λ < 1`, which touches `S` nowhere;
`edgesCover_gridBoundary_ringSet` is the corrected statement — the boundary cycle of a grid on
`[-r, r]²` occupies `ringSet r` — and `gridGraph_inner_cycle` packages it with the
disjointness from `S` that makes the freshness clauses vacuous for the grid.

## Gap 1 — nothing was proved about `squareMesh` itself

`squareMesh δ fresh anchors` is `overlayGraph` applied to the mesh segments and to a list of
cut points obtained from `exists_cut_points` **by choice**. Its edges are the pieces of a
subdivision nobody can enumerate, so no clause about *its* combinatorics follows from the grid
results, which are about a different graph.

One general fact about `overlayGraph` is missing, and it is stated here as the explicit
hypothesis `SubdividesToPath`: *the overlay edges lying inside a source segment are exactly the
edges of a path of the overlay from one end of that segment to the other.* That is a statement
about `Schoenflies.overlayGraph` and `Schoenflies.subdivide` alone — believed, and
dischargeable, since the pieces of the subdivision of a segment have pairwise disjoint interiors
and cover it, so the distance from one end orders them into a chain. It is not a restatement of
any goal here: the whole content below is the *assembly*, which the hypothesis does not contain.

From it:

* `meshGraph_outer_cycle` / `squareMesh_outer_cycle_of_subdividesToPath` — clause 3 **as a
  cycle**, for the mesh
  itself. The four sides of the outer ring are four overlay paths; three concatenations
  (`Graph.IsPath.append_of_disjoint`) glue them into one path once round `S`, and the first step
  of the *reversed* fourth side is peeled off to close the cycle. The result is a
  `Graph.IsLongCycle` of the mesh whose edges occupy exactly `modelCurve`.
* `squareMesh_outer_cycleGraph_isTwoConnected_of_subdividesToPath` — hence the outer ring is a
  2-connected subgraph
  of the mesh, which is the first step of the blueprint's assembly of clause 5.

**Full 2-connectivity of `squareMesh` is NOT proved here, and is not assumed either.** What
remains is the rest of that assembly: the inner rings as cycles (the same argument, with
`ringPieces r` in place of `ringPieces 1`), the crossing points `r • z` as vertices (which needs
the `MeetsAreCut` clause of `meshPoints`), and then each spoke segment between consecutive rings
attached as an ear — for which one also needs the two arcs of an already-built cycle between two
of its vertices. None of that is short.

The degeneracy the audit asked about is settled, with a proof rather than an assertion:
`not_isTwoConnected_squareMesh_of_fresh_nil`. With no fresh point the mesh is
`meshCount δ ≥ 2` disjoint concentric frames and is not even connected, so clause 5 is **false**
as stated for `squareMesh δ [] anchors`. With exactly one fresh point it is connected but every
interior vertex of the single spoke is a cut vertex; that case is discussed in the section
docstring and not formalised. Every statement of clause 5 for the mesh must therefore carry a
hypothesis giving two distinct fresh points.

## Blueprint

* `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` — `isPathGraph_pair`, `pieceListGraph_splitAllAt_eq`,
  `pieceListGraph_splitAllAt_isTwoConnected`, `pieceListGraph_subdivide_isTwoConnected`.
* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 5 for the inner grid, **after** subdivision —
  `gridGraph_subdivide_isTwoConnected`.
* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 3 for the inner grid at the right radius —
  `edgesCover_gridBoundary_ringSet`, `gridGraph_inner_cycle`.
* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clauses 3 and 4, the obstruction to a grid on all of `Q` —
  `gridGraph_full_square_aligned_ends`.
* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 3 as a cycle, for the mesh — `SubdividesToPath`,
  `meshGraph_outer_cycle`, `squareMesh_outer_cycle_of_subdividesToPath`.
* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 5, the first step for the mesh and the degenerate case —
  `squareMesh_outer_cycleGraph_isTwoConnected_of_subdividesToPath`,
  `not_isTwoConnected_squareMesh_of_fresh_nil`.
* `lem:union-two-connected` is *not* used here; the assembly that would use it is the part left
  open.

/-! ### Cutting a list of segments cleanly

`splitAllAt q l` cuts **every** piece of `l` that has `q` in its interior. To read the result
as one subdivision of one edge — which is what `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve` is about — the
point must be interior to at most one piece; and to keep the replacement path's middle vertex
new, the point must not already be an end. A point that is interior to no piece cuts nothing
at all, and is harmless. -/

/-- `q` cuts the list `l` cleanly: it is interior to at most one piece, and either it is
interior to none or it is an end of none.

Both branches of the disjunction occur in the intended use: a point of the cut list that has
already been cut out is interior to nothing, and a point not yet used is an end of nothing. -/

/-! ### The inner grid, subdivided

For a grid the cleanliness hypothesis costs nothing. Two distinct grid edges meet only at a
grid point (`gridPt_of_mem_two_edges`), a grid point on a grid edge is an end of it
(`end_of_gridPt_mem_seg`), and an end of a nondegenerate segment is not interior to it. So
*every* point cuts the grid cleanly, and the subdivision theorem applies with no hypothesis on
the cut points at all. -/

/-- **The obstruction to a grid spanning all of `Q`.** For a strictly increasing grid on
`[-1,1]²` and any interior column `0 < i < m`, the two grid points `(xc i, -1)` and
`(xc i, 1)` both lie on `S`, they share their first coordinate, and each is an end of a grid
edge that does *not* lie on `S`.

Clause 3 of `prop:anchored-square-mesh` says every internal edge meeting `S` ends at a fresh
point of `u(𝒜)`. Applied to such a grid it therefore demands that `u(𝒜)` contain **both**
points of a vertically aligned pair, for every interior column — and, by the same argument on
rows, for every interior row. Density of `u(𝒜)` in `S` supplies no aligned pair, and clause 2
makes the demand unavoidable: an old boundary vertex on the bottom side forces a coordinate
`xc i`, and that coordinate forces the point `(xc i, 1)` opposite it.

The blueprint's grid therefore fills the *inner* square `λQ` with `λ < 1`, where the clauses
are vacuous by `gridGraph_inner_cycle`; the collar between `λQ` and `S`, not the grid, carries
the fresh points and their single spokes. -/

/-! ### The mesh needs at least two fresh points

The audit asks whether the plan for clause 5 is false when the fresh set is small. It is, and
this section proves the extreme case rather than asserting it: with no fresh point there is no
spoke, the mesh is `meshCount δ ≥ 2` pairwise disjoint concentric frames, and the graph is not
even connected.

The invariant is the sup norm. Every mesh segment other than a spoke lies on one ring, so with
`fresh = []` both ends of every edge have the same sup norm and a walk cannot change it. The
corner of the outer ring has sup norm `1`, the corner of the innermost ring has `N⁻¹ ≠ 1`.

**With exactly one fresh point `z` the mesh is connected but still not 2-connected**: the spoke
at `z` is the only thing joining the rings, so each of its interior vertices — the crossing
points `(k/N) • z` for `0 < k < N` — is a cut vertex, separating the rings inside it from the
rings outside. That case is *not* formalised here; it needs the crossing points to be vertices,
which needs the `MeetsAreCut` clause of the mesh's cut points, and then a separation argument.
It is recorded so that no consumer states clause 5 for `squareMesh` without a hypothesis
guaranteeing two distinct fresh points. -/

/-! ### The outer cycle of the mesh

The four sides of the outer ring are four overlay paths; three concatenations glue them into
one path once round `S`, and the last edge of the fourth is peeled off to close the cycle.
Peeling is why the fourth side is reversed: `Graph.IsPath` is built at the *source* end, so its
first step is the one that can be split off, and the first step of the reversed side is the
last edge of the side. -/

/-- **`prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 3 as a cycle, for the mesh graph itself.** The edges
of the mesh lying on `S` form a cycle of the mesh graph, and they occupy exactly `S`.

`Schoenflies.cover_outerEdges` proves only the point-set half of this, and
`SquareMeshConnected.gridGraph_outer_cycle` proves the cycle for a *different* graph. This is
the statement for `Schoenflies.meshGraph`.

The conclusion is existential because the hypothesis `SubdividesToPath` is: nothing here can
name the edge list of a side without choosing it. Once that hypothesis is discharged by a
theorem exporting the chain as a `def`, this should be restated with the cycle as data. -/
