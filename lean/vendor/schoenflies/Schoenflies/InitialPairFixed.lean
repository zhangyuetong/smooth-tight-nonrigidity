# The complete construction of `prop:initial-pair`

`Schoenflies/InitialPair.lean` builds the initial matched pair but leaves three things that
`def:matched-pair` and `prop:initial-pair` actually assert:

1. **the anchor clause.** The blueprint chooses `a, b ∈ 𝒜`, the fixed countable dense set of
   *strongly accessible* points of `prop:countable-strong-access` (tex 1403–1418). `InitialData`
   records neither the anchor set nor the strong accessibility of `a` and `b`, so nothing
   downstream can build a further crosscut ending at them, and `lem:anchor-density` — which
   needs the anchors of every stage to be points of `𝒜` — has nothing to attach to.
   `Schoenflies.AnchorSet` is `𝒜` as data, `Schoenflies.AnchoredInitialData` is the initial pair
   with the clause recorded, and `Schoenflies.AnchoredInitialData.stronglyAccessible_a` /
   `.exists_access_segment_a` turn it back into the straight access segment `lem:tangent-cone`
   supplies.
2. **the matched labelling.** `InitialData.source_closure_cell_inter` labels the two source
   2-cells by the two boundary arcs `A₁, A₂` of `C`, and `.target_closure_cell_inter` labels the
   two target 2-cells by the two boundary arcs of `S` — independently. Nothing said the two
   labellings correspond, which is the whole content of a *matched* pair.
   `Schoenflies.InitialData.tgt_arcOf_eq_image` (`tgt.arcOf k = u '' src.arcOf k`),
   `.skeletonHomeo_image_arcOf` and `.closure_cell_face_link` supply the link.
3. **`def:admissible-graph` for the target**: "all its edges are polygonal".
   `Schoenflies.InitialData.isPolygonal_tgt_edgeArc` and
   `.isPolygonal_targetRealization_skeletonSet`.

It also carried two hypotheses, `harc` (`thm:arc-complement`) and `hcollars`
(`lem:crosscut-collars`), both of which are now theorems on `main`
(`Schoenflies.arc_complement`, `Schoenflies.IsCrosscut.hasArcCollars`). Every headline result is
restated here after supplying them; the primed names distinguish these strengthened statements.

Finally, `initBoundary` is a raw datum in `CellStructure`, and nothing checked that the two
lists it holds are closed walks of `initSkel` whose cells are exactly `faceCells`. They are:
`Schoenflies.isWalk_initBoundary_false`, `.._true`, and `Schoenflies.mem_faceCells_iff`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.AnchorSet`, `Schoenflies.nonempty_anchorSet`, `Schoenflies.anchorSet` —
  `prop:countable-strong-access` as the *fixed* set `𝒜` of tex 1418.
* `Schoenflies.AnchoredInitialData`, `Schoenflies.exists_anchoredInitialData`,
  `Schoenflies.anchoredInitialData`, `Schoenflies.initialData` — `prop:initial-pair` including
  the dropped clause "two further points `a, b ∈ 𝒜`", the last one with the canonical anchor
  set supplied.
* `Schoenflies.stronglyAccessible_initialData_a`, `.._b` — the strong accessibility of the two
  chosen points of the canonical pair, which is what the dropped clause was *for*.
* `Schoenflies.AnchoredInitialData.stronglyAccessible_a`, `.stronglyAccessible_b`,
  `.exists_access_segment_a`, `.exists_access_segment_b` — `lem:tangent-cone` at the two
  anchors, the form `lem:accessible-endpoints` consumes at every later stage.
* `Schoenflies.isWalk_initBoundary_false`, `Schoenflies.isWalk_initBoundary_true`,
  `Schoenflies.mem_faceCells_iff`, `Schoenflies.boundaryCycles_initialStructure` — the boundary
  datum of `def:matched-cellulation` really is the simple boundary cycle of each 2-cell and
  carries exactly its strict subcells.
* `Schoenflies.HexData.isPolygonal_arcOf`, `.isPolygonal_outerArcs`,
  `Schoenflies.isPolygonal_modelCurve`, `Schoenflies.InitialData.isPolygonal_tgt_edgeArc`,
  `.isPolygonal_targetRealization_skeletonSet` — the clause "all its edges are polygonal" of
  `def:admissible-graph` for the target realization.
* `Schoenflies.InitialData.src_arcOf_eq_image`, `.tgt_arcOf_eq_image`,
  `.skeletonHomeo_image_arcOf`, `.closure_cell_face_link`, `.closure_cell_face_link_homeo` —
  clause 1 of `def:matched-pair` ("the two distinguished outer cycles correspond") at the level
  of the two boundary arcs, and the correspondence of the two 2-cell labellings.
* `Schoenflies.InitialData.u_src_pos`, `.tgt_pos_corners`, `.u_a_mem_openTop`,
  `.u_b_mem_openBottom` — the geometric content of the `prop:initial-pair` sentence: `C` is
  subdivided at the `u`-preimages of the four corners, and `a, b` lie in two nonadjacent
  corner arcs.
* `Schoenflies.InitialData.source_cells_cover'`, `.source_cell_isComponent'`,
  `.source_closure_cell_inter'`, `.source_cells_ne'`, `.target_cells_cover'`,
  `.target_closure_cell_inter'`, `.target_cell_isComponent`, `.target_cells_ne` —
  `thm:general-crosscut` on both sides, with its hypotheses supplied.
* `Schoenflies.exists_initialData'`, `Schoenflies.initial_pair'` — `prop:initial-pair`, with the
  anchor clause and the matched labelling in the statement.

anywhere. For `initialStructure` it does. Both lists are *closed* walks of `initSkel`, and the
cells they run through are exactly the `faceCells` that `initSub` declares to be subcells of the
corresponding 2-cell — so the base value of `≼_abs` is not an independent choice. -/

`def:matched-pair` clause 1 asks that "the two distinguished outer cycles correspond". On the
initial pair this is not automatic from the abstract structure alone: `arcOf` is read off the
*geometry* of each realization, so the two 2-cell labellings — `source_closure_cell_inter'` and
`target_closure_cell_inter'` — are made independently. They correspond because the source
outer edges are, by construction, the `w`-images of the target ones. -/

realization is `C` subdivided at the `u`-preimages of the four corners of `Q` and at two further

`D` from `a` to `b`, and whose target realization is `S` correspondingly subdivided together
with the straight chord `[u(a), u(b)]`.

Beyond `Schoenflies.initial_pair` this adds: no hypotheses at all; the anchor clause with its
consequence that `a` and `b` are strongly accessible; the polygonality of every target edge; and
