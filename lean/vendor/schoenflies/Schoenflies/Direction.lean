# Directions, and the two arcs cut out by a pair of rays

This module supplies the *direction facts* that the two-sided strip lemma runs on. Everything
here is stated through the sign of the orientation form `Plane.det`: no angle is named, no
inverse trigonometric function appears, and no case distinction on the sense of a turn is
ever made.

A *direction* is a unit vector (`Plane.IsDirection`). What actually matters about a direction
is its ray — the set of its positive multiples — because every predicate below is invariant
under positive scaling (`Plane.smul_mem_arcCCW`). So the arcs are defined on all nonzero
vectors and the unit-vector normalisation `Plane.dir` is only a convenience.

## The two arcs

Two directions `u` and `w` that are neither equal nor opposite are exactly two directions with
`det u w ≠ 0` (`Plane.det_ne_zero_iff`). They cut the circle of directions into two open arcs.
The arc traversed counterclockwise from `u` to `w` is `Plane.arcCCW u w`, defined by Sedgewick's
`ccw` predicate on the triple `(u, d, w)`: at least two of the three consecutive orientation
forms are positive. This definition is manifestly invariant under rotating the triple, and — this
is the point — it is correct for *both* arcs at once, the short one and the long one, with no
sign hypothesis in the definition itself.

`Plane.mem_ray_or_mem_arcCCW` and `Plane.arcCCW_disjoint` say that the two arcs and the two
bounding rays partition the nonzero vectors.

## The transfer fact

`Plane.same_arc_of_det_neg_of_det_pos` is Appendix C's transfer fact: *a direction with negative
`det` against the first ray lies on the same arc as a direction with positive `det` against the
second*. Note that no nearness hypothesis is needed for it — see the module note below.

## Blueprint

* `Plane.IsDirection`, `Plane.dir`, `Plane.arcCCW`, `Plane.det_ne_zero_iff`,
  `Plane.mem_ray_or_mem_arcCCW`, `Plane.arcCCW_disjoint` — Appendix C, item 1, "two distinct,
  non-opposite unit vectors bound two open arcs of directions".
* `Plane.same_arc_of_det_neg_of_det_pos` — Appendix C, item 1, the transfer fact.
* `Plane.exists_isDirection_det_ne_zero`, `Plane.exists_isDirection_det_and_inner_ne_zero` —
  Appendix C, item 1, "the existence of a unit vector avoiding any prescribed finite set of
  directions".
* `Plane.germs_split`, `Plane.exists_germ_threshold` — the vertex matching inside Lemma 1.8
  (Two-sided polygonal strips): the two left half-strip germs land on one arc and the two right
  ones on the other.

## A note on "near"

Appendix C states the transfer fact for directions *near* the two bounding rays. The nearness is
not needed: `Plane.mem_arcCCW_rev_iff` shows that the arc counterclockwise from `w` to `u` is cut
out by a *disjunction* of two sign conditions, so a single sign suffices to land on it. The
mirror statement — a direction with positive `det` against `u` and one with negative `det`
against `w` both lie on `arcCCW u w` — is *not* available from one sign each, because that arc is
cut out by the *conjunction* (`Plane.mem_arcCCW_iff`). Lemma 1.8 needs the mirror statement too,
for the two right germs, and there the missing second sign is exactly what "`s/t` small" buys:
`Plane.exists_germ_threshold` supplies it, with an explicit threshold.

A nonzero `d` lies on it when at least two of the three consecutive orientation forms of the

/-- Fix the orientation by `0 < det u w`, so that `w` is counterclockwise of `u` by less than a
half turn. Then the arc counterclockwise from `u` to `w` is the *short* one, and membership is
the conjunction of two sign conditions. -/

/-! ### Half-strip germs

Fix a vertex with incoming unit tangent `u` and outgoing unit tangent `w`, and let `r₁ = -u`,
`r₂ = w` be the two rays leaving the vertex, so that `perp r₁ = -u^⊥` and `perp r₂ = w^⊥`.
Then the four half-strip germs of Lemma 1.8 are, in the blueprint's own notation,

* incoming left, `-t u + s u^⊥ = t • r₁ - s • perp r₁`;
* outgoing left, `t w + s w^⊥ = t • r₂ + s • perp r₂`;
* incoming right, `-t u - s u^⊥ = t • r₁ + s • perp r₁`;
* outgoing right, `t w - s w^⊥ = t • r₂ - s • perp r₂`,

each with `t, s > 0`. The four computations below place them on the two arcs. -/
