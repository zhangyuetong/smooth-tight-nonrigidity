# From a sequence of transferred stages to a `LimitTower`

Two interfaces in this library were designed from opposite ends and have never met.

* `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair` (`FiniteTransfer.lean`) is what `thm:finite-transfer` consumes and
  produces: one abstract cell structure, its two realizations, the skeleton homeomorphism, the
  two cell decompositions, and weak admissibility on both sides.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.LimitTower` (`LimitMap.lean`) is what the limit section consumes:
  the same data indexed by `ℕ`, plus the nesting and the two halves of `prop:shrinking-stars`.

This module joins them. `Schoenflies.StageSequence` is a sequence of `GeneratedPair`s carrying
exactly the extra data the recursion of `quantitative-refinement` produces at each step — the
shared parent map, the growth of the source skeleton, the nesting of the skeleton maps, and the
two shrinking estimates — and `StageSequence.limitTower` turns one into a `LimitTower` for the
concrete source and target of the problem.

Every field is either read off a
`GeneratedPair` or is one of the four recorded facts about the concrete domains. The point of
writing it before the recursion exists is that it pins the interface down: the recursion now has
a single named target, and any mismatch between what `thm:finite-transfer` delivers and what the
limit section demands shows up here rather than at the end. Two such mismatches would otherwise
have been easy to miss, and both check out:

* `LimitTower` wants the *same* parent map on both sides (`srcRefines` and `tgtRefines` along one
  `par n`). `IsPartialTransferOf` delivers exactly that — its `refines_src` and `refines_tgt`
  share `par` — which is `lem:refinement-compatibility`(c).
* `LimitTower` wants the two cell decompositions against *closed* domains `C ∪ D` and `Q`, and
  `GeneratedPair` is parametrized by exactly those two sets.

## The four facts about the concrete domains

`LimitTower` asks for the source domain to be closed and bounded and its interior open, and the
same for the target. On the source side `IsSeparating C` gives all three:
`Schoenflies.isClosed_union_inside`, `Schoenflies.union_inside_sdiff` with
`IsSeparating.isOpen_inside`, and boundedness through `C = frontier (inside C) ⊆ closure (inside C)`
— which is why `isBounded_dom` needs no extra hypothesis, though `LimitMap.lean` warns that it is
not optional (`Metric.diam` is `0` on an unbounded set). On the target side they are the standard
facts about the square.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.StageSequence` — the output of the recursion of the section *Quantitative
  refinement*: the stage-`n` matched cellulations `(Γ_n, Γ'_n)` with their parent maps and the
  two convergence statements of `prop:shrinking-stars`.
* `Schoenflies.StageSequence.limitTower` — the passage to the head of the section *The limit
  homeomorphism of the interiors*, i.e. to `tex 2568`'s "we now forget how the decompositions
  were constructed".
* `Schoenflies.StageSequence.isHomeoOn_F`, `.interior_homeomorphism` —
  **`prop:interior-homeomorphism`** for a stage sequence, which is the third conjunct of
  `Schoenflies.HasLimitHomeomorphism`.

/-! ### The concrete domains

`LimitTower` is stated for arbitrary closed domains; the construction uses two. These are the
facts it asks about them, collected so that `limitTower` below reads as a repackaging. -/

/-- The closed Jordan domain is bounded. `IsSeparating` does not say so directly — it says the
*inside* is bounded — but `C` is the frontier of the inside, hence inside its closure. -/

  rw [Set.union_comm, ← (IsRegionOf.inside C).closure_eq hC]

/-- The interior of the closed Jordan domain is open — after the rewriting `LimitTower` needs,
which asks for `IsOpen (dom \ bdry)` rather than `IsOpen (inside C)`. -/
theorem isOpen_union_inside_sdiff (hC : IsSeparating C) : IsOpen ((C ∪ inside C) \ C) := by

/-! ### A sequence of transferred stages -/

/-- **The output of the recursion of *Quantitative refinement*.**

A sequence of generated matched cellulations of the closed Jordan domain and the closed square,
each refining its predecessor along one parent map shared by the two sides, with growing source
skeletons, nested skeleton maps, and the two convergence statements of `prop:shrinking-stars`.

Every field beyond `stage` and `base` is something the recursion establishes at the step that
produces it; none is a property of a single stage, which is why they cannot live in
`GeneratedPair`. -/
