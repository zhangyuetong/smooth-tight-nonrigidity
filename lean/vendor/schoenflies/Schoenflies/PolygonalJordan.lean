# The polygonal Jordan curve theorem

Theorem 2.3: the complement of a simple closed polygon has exactly two regions, one bounded and
one unbounded, and each has the polygon as its frontier. Moreover the crossing parity of §2 is
`1` on the bounded region and `0` on the unbounded one.

## The three inputs, and where each is spent

* **Lemma 1.8, the collar** (`Schoenflies.StripData`, `StripData.local_two_sided`,
  `StripData.carrier_subset_closure_sideL`). It supplies the two *tracks* `N_L`, `N_R`: connected,
  disjoint, off the curve, together filling `N ∖ C`, and each with the whole curve in its closure.
* **Lemma 1.3, the nearest-point segment** (`Plane.notMem_of_mem_segment_of_isMinOn`). It gets an
  arbitrary point of the complement onto a track: walk from it to a nearest point of the curve;
  the walk misses the curve, and its final stretch is inside the collar.
* **Lemma 2.2, crossing parity** (`ClosedPolygon.parity_eq_of_mem_connectedComponentIn_carrier`,
  `ClosedPolygon.parity_flip_carrier`). It keeps the two tracks apart: they cannot be joined
  inside the complement, because a point just before and a point just after an edge differ in
  parity and parity is constant on a connected subset of the complement.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.exists_opposite_parity_sides`,
  `…parity_ne_of_mem_sides`, `…connectedComponentIn_ne_of_mem_sides` — the two tracks of the
  collar carry different parities, hence lie in different components. The "at least two" half.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.exists_mem_sides_connectedComponentIn`,
  `…connectedComponentIn_eq_of_notMem` — every point of the complement lies in the component of a
  point of a track. The "at most two" half.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isSeparating_carrier` — **Theorem 2.3**, in the form Definition 2.4
  asks for: `IsSeparating P.carrier`. With it come `inside P.carrier` and `outside P.carrier` as
  the blueprint's `Int(C)` and `Ext(C)`, and the whole `IsSeparating` API of
  `Schoenflies/CrosscutCells.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.connectedComponentIn_eq_inside_or_outside` — "exactly two regions",
  explicitly: the component of any point off the polygon is one of the two named regions.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.parity_eq_one_of_mem_inside`,
  `…parity_eq_zero_of_mem_outside` — the last sentence of Theorem 2.3, `π_C = 1` inside and
  `π_C = 0` outside, for **every** admissible ray direction, not just for one chosen at the start.
* `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.polygonal_jordan` — the same theorem with `IsSeparating` unfolded,
  for a reader who wants the statement without the definition.
* `Schoenflies.isSeparating_unitTriangle` — non-vacuity: the whole chain applies to the one
  polygon the development constructs.

## Two facts restated

`isBounded_closedSquare` and `not_isBounded_beyondSquare` below are stated `private`. They are
*not* new: they exist as `Graph.isBounded_closedSquare` and `Graph.not_isBounded_beyondSquare` in
`Schoenflies/Graph/OuterFace.lean`. Neither has any graph content — they are plane facts about
`Schoenflies.Plane.closedSquare` whose home is `Schoenflies/Bounded.lean` — and importing the
whole plane-graph layer into the polygonal Jordan curve theorem, which every later graph
argument depends on, would invert the layering. They are `private` so that the duplicate names
cannot collide when the integrator hoists the originals.

/-! ### At least two regions: the two tracks are separated by one crossing

The blueprint: "Choose a sufficiently small disk `B` around an interior point of an edge, and
reference points `z_L ∈ B ∩ N_L`, `z_R ∈ B ∩ N_R` in its two components. The two reference points
have opposite parity."

The disk is the one of `StripData.local_two_sided`; the two reference points are the two points
just before and just after the midpoint of the edge *in the ray direction*, which is what makes
`parity_flip_carrier` applicable to them. That they land in the two different tracks is read off
the sign of their transverse coordinate `det (tang i) (· - vertex i)`, and the two signs are
opposite and nonzero because `det (tang i) u ≠ 0` — the edge is not parallel to the ray. -/

/-- **The two tracks of the collar carry different parities.** The witnesses are a point just
before and a point just after the midpoint of the edge `i` in the ray direction: they lie in the
two different tracks, and the crossing count changes by one between them. -/

/-! ### Packaging: from "exactly two components" to `IsSeparating`

`Schoenflies/CrosscutCells.lean` defines `inside C` and `outside C` as the union of the bounded
and of the unbounded components of `Cᶜ`, *without* any separation hypothesis, and Definition 2.4
is the assertion that each of the two is a single region with boundary `C`. So the last step of
Theorem 2.3 is to identify the two components found above with `inside C` and `outside C`, and
that identification needs no case analysis on which of them is which: the one that swallows the
outside of a containing square is the unbounded one by definition, and the other is caught inside
the square. -/

lies in the unbounded region." Here `q` is chosen to be beyond a containing *square* as well, so
that it visibly lies in the unbounded region: the outside of that square is connected, misses the
polygon, and is unbounded. -/
