# Inversion in the unit circle, and the density of strongly accessible points

Two consequences of the Jordan curve theorem which have nothing to do with one another beyond
becoming available at the same moment.

## Inversion exchanges the two sides

Inversion about the unit circle centred at `a`,

    I_a(x) = a + (x - a) / ‖x - a‖²,

is the device that turns the *bounded* Schönflies theorem into the unbounded one: it swaps the
two sides of a Jordan curve `C` around any interior point `a`, sending the exterior of `C` onto
the interior of `C^a = I_a(C)` punctured at `a`. So a closed-interior extension for `C^a`,
pushed back through `I_a`, is a closed-*exterior* extension for `C`, which is
`prop:exterior-extension` and the second half of `thm:main`.

The map is Mathlib's `EuclideanGeometry.inversion a 1`, repackaged here as `Schoenflies.invert`
with the three facts the geometry needs: `Schoenflies.dist_invert_center`
(`‖I_a(x) - a‖ = 1/‖x - a‖`), `Schoenflies.invert_involutive`, and continuity away from `a`.
`Schoenflies.invertHomeo` bundles it as a self-homeomorphism of the punctured plane, which is
the form the conjugation `I_b ∘ f ∘ I_a` of `prop:exterior-extension` will want.

The proof of `lem:inversion-sides` is the blueprint's. Put `U = I_a(Ext C) ∪ {a}`. It is

* *open*: away from `a` because `I_a` is a homeomorphism of the punctured plane, and at `a`
  because `C ∪ Int(C)` is bounded, so the complement of a large closed ball `B̄(a, R)` lies in
  `Ext(C)` and inverts onto `B(a, 1/R) ∖ {a}`;
* *bounded*: a ball `B(a, δ)` lies in `Int(C)`, so exterior points stay at distance `≥ δ` from
  `a` and their inverses at distance `≤ 1/δ`;
* *connected*: the continuous image of `Ext(C)`, together with `a`, which is a limit of it
  because `Ext(C)` is unbounded;
* *bounded by `C^a`*: the third region `I_a(Int(C) ∖ {a})` is open, so the frontier of `U` can
  only be `C^a`, and every point of `C^a` is in it because `C = ∂Ext(C)`.

Being open, connected and with frontier disjoint from `(C^a)ᶜ`, `U` is a component of `(C^a)ᶜ`
(`Schoenflies.Plane.connectedComponentIn_eq_of_frontier_disjoint`); being bounded, it is
`Int(C^a)`.

## The closed-exterior extension

`prop:exterior-extension` is the short assembly that sits on top of it, stated parametrically
over `prop:pointed-extension`. `Schoenflies.PointedInteriorExtension` is that interface, written
out: the bounded theorem with a prescribed interior point. `Schoenflies/Endgame.lean` derives
it from the closed-interior extension together with `lem:square-point-mover`, and
`Schoenflies/JordanSchoenflies.lean` supplies the square-extension input.

The assembly needs a name for "restricts to a homeomorphism onto", since it composes four of
them; `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` is that, in the unbundled `Schoenflies.Plane.IsSquareMover`
style.

## Density of strongly accessible points

`lem:tangent-dense` is three lines on top of `thm:jordan` and `lem:nearest-strong`: a point of
`C` is a limit of points of the region because `C` is the region's frontier, and the nearest
point of `C` to such a point is strongly accessible and no further from `p` than twice the
distance we started with. It is stated here for either region, since nothing in the argument
distinguishes them.

Everything below inherits the standing hypothesis of `thm:jordan` on `main`,

    harc : ∀ A : Set Plane, IsArc A → IsConnected Aᶜ

threaded verbatim through every statement that consumes
`Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.isSeparating`. The two density statements, which are about an
abstract `IsSeparating` curve, do not need it.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.invert` and its algebra — the map `I_a` of §"The closed exteriors".
* `Schoenflies.invertHomeo` — "`I_a` is an involutive homeomorphism of `ℝ² ∖ {a}`".
* `Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.invert_image` — "`C^a` is a Jordan curve", the first sentence of
  the proof of `lem:inversion-sides`.
* `Schoenflies.invert_image_outside`, `Schoenflies.invert_image_outside_union_singleton`,
  `Schoenflies.invert_image_inside_diff`, `Schoenflies.invert_image_union_outside`,
  `Schoenflies.inversion_sides` — `lem:inversion-sides`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_stronglyAccessible_dist_lt`, `Schoenflies.tangent_dense`,
  `Schoenflies.tangent_dense_inside` — `lem:tangent-dense`.
* `Schoenflies.PointedInteriorExtension` — the `prop:pointed-extension` interface, discharged
  by `Schoenflies.pointed_extension` in `Schoenflies/Endgame.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.exterior_extension` — `prop:exterior-extension`, parametrically on that interface.
* `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` — no blueprint statement; the language "restricts to a homeomorphism
  of `S` onto `T`" that `prop:exterior-extension` is phrased in.

`Schoenflies.invert a` is `EuclideanGeometry.inversion a 1`, which Mathlib defines for every
point including the centre, sending `a` to itself. That convention is what makes
`Schoenflies.invert_involutive` hypothesis-free, and it costs nothing: every statement below
that cares about the centre says so. -/

/-! ### Homeomorphisms between subsets of the plane

`prop:exterior-extension` is a composition of four restricted homeomorphisms, so it needs a
name for "`f` restricts to a homeomorphism of `S` onto `T`". `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` is that
name, written the way `Schoenflies.Plane.IsSquareMover` writes the same thing: unbundled, with
the inverse named, so that composing two of them composes two honest functions `Plane → Plane`
instead of producing a subtype-valued `Homeomorph` that must be unwrapped at every use.

**This notion is general and belongs in a lower module.** It is here because
`prop:exterior-extension` is the first statement that needs it; the integrator should hoist it
(and check that no concurrent branch introduced a twin). -/

/-! ### The closed-exterior extension

`prop:exterior-extension`, assuming `prop:pointed-extension`. That is the blueprint's own
citation, and it is the one statement of the endgame that is not yet available: it rests on
`thm:closed-interior-extension` (open) together with `lem:square-point-mover`
(`Schoenflies.Plane.exists_squareMover`, on `main`) and `lem:jordan-circle`
(`Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.homeomorph`, on `main`).

Everything that inversion contributes is here; discharging
`Schoenflies.PointedInteriorExtension` finishes the exterior half of `thm:main`. -/

/-- **`prop:pointed-extension`**, as a hypothesis: a boundary homeomorphism between two Jordan
curves extends to a homeomorphism of the closed interiors carrying one prescribed interior
point to another.

This is *not* a restatement of `prop:exterior-extension`: it is about the two **interiors**,
which is the bounded theorem, and it is what the blueprint proves from
`thm:closed-interior-extension` and `lem:square-point-mover`. -/
def PointedInteriorExtension : Prop :=
  ∀ (C C' : Set Plane) (f g : Plane → Plane) (a b : Plane),
    IsJordanCurve C → IsJordanCurve C' → IsHomeoOn f g C C' → a ∈ inside C → b ∈ inside C' →
      ∃ F G : Plane → Plane,
        IsHomeoOn F G (C ∪ inside C) (C' ∪ inside C') ∧ EqOn F f C ∧ F a = b

/-- **`prop:exterior-extension` (closed-exterior extension).** Every homeomorphism between two
Jordan curves extends to a homeomorphism of their closed exteriors.

Assumes `prop:pointed-extension` (`Schoenflies.PointedInteriorExtension`) and the standing
hypothesis `harc` of `thm:jordan`. The proof is the blueprint's: choose `a ∈ Int(C)` and
`b ∈ Int(C')`, invert about each, extend the conjugated boundary map `I_b ∘ f ∘ I_a` over the
interior of `C^a` so that `a ↦ b`, delete the two centres, and conjugate back — the deleted
punctured closed interiors being exactly the closed exteriors, by `lem:inversion-sides`. -/

/-! ### Density of strongly accessible points

`lem:tangent-dense`. Nothing here distinguishes the two regions, so the lemma is proved for
either. The hypotheses are those of `Schoenflies.stronglyAccessible_of_isMinOn`: the region
swallows the component of each of its points, and the curve is in its closure — which for a
separating curve is `C = ∂Ω`. -/

/-- The core estimate. If `C` is compact and every point of `C` is a limit of points of `Ω`,
and `Ω` swallows the component in `Cᶜ` of each of its points, then near any `p ∈ C` there is a
strongly accessible point of `C`: pick `q ∈ Ω` within `ε/2` of `p`, and take the point of `C`
nearest to `q`; it is strongly accessible by `lem:nearest-strong` and within `2‖q - p‖` of
`p`. -/
