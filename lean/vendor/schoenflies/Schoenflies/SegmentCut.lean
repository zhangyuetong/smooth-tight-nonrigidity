# Cutting a segment

Mathlib has no lemma splitting a segment at an interior point, and the polygonal subdivision
of Layer 6 is built entirely out of one: cutting loses nothing (`segment_split`) and cutting
is permanent (`openSegment_left_subset`, `openSegment_right_subset` — each half's interior
stays inside the whole's, so nothing later can put a removed point back into an interior).

Everything here is an identity between convex combinations. The `⊇` half of the split is
convexity; the `⊆` half rescales the parameter, and the only case analysis is on whether the
far coefficient vanishes.

## Blueprint

* `segment_split` — cutting at a point of the segment loses nothing; underneath
  `subdivide_covers`.
* `openSegment_left_subset`, `openSegment_right_subset` — a cut is permanent; underneath
  `subdivide_inside`.
