# Transporting a skeleton homeomorphism across an edge subdivision

`Schoenflies/RealizeSubdiv.lean` builds `SubdivData.realize`, the realization of a subdivided
cell structure, and closes with the observation that it does **not** move the realized
1-skeleton (`SubdivData.skeletonSet_realize`). It also names what was missing: a
`CellStructure.SkeletonHomeo` between two realizations does not, by itself, carry the *half*
arcs of a subdivided edge onto each other. That gap is what `Schoenflies/ArcMonotone.lean`
fills, and this module spends.

`SubdivData.realizeHomeo` is the transported homeomorphism. As a point map it is *unchanged* —
`realizeHomeo_toFun` is `rfl` — which is exactly what `CellStructure.LimitTower.skelHomeo_succ`
in `Schoenflies/LimitMap.lean` asks for ("an edge subdivision leaves the skeleton map unchanged
as a point map"), and through it `Schoenflies.StageSequence`.

## The target parameter, and the two orientations

Subdividing at parameter `t` on the source side means subdividing at the parameter on the
target side where `R₂.drawing d.edge` sits at `g.toFun (R₁.drawing d.edge t)`. That is
`SubdivData.targetParam`, a plain `def` built from `Schoenflies.transferParam`; a caller never
has to guess it, and `SubdivData.drawing_targetParam` is its defining property.

`RealizeSubdiv.lean` warns that `IsDrawing.edge_param` is orientation-free, so `drawing e 0` may
be either end of `e`, and reads the orientation off with `SubdivData.leftParam`. The same issue
arises here on the `R₂` side, **and it is not forced**: the two realizations are independent
data, so nothing prevents `R₁` from drawing `d.edge` from `d.left` and `R₂` from drawing it from
`d.right`. This module does not assume otherwise. It does not need a second case distinction
either, because the transfer map handles it:

  `SubdivData.targetParam_leftParam` : `targetParam (leftParam R₁) = leftParam R₂`

holds whatever the two orientations are — `g` carries `R₁.pos d.left` to `R₂.pos d.left`, and
`leftParam R₂` is by definition the parameter sitting there. Correspondingly the arc identity
imported from `ArcMonotone` is stated over `uIcc`, which is unordered, so the two halves match
up without either orientation ever being named. The one place the orientations do surface is
`SubdivData.targetParam_ends`, which records that the pair `(targetParam 0, targetParam 1)` is
`(0, 1)` or `(1, 0)` — the input `ArcMonotone.param_mem_Ioo_of_ends` needs to know the new
target parameter is interior.

## Blueprint

* `def:matched-pair`, clause 3 — the transported `edgeArc_image` at the two new 1-cells is
  precisely "on each corresponding pair of edges, `g` restricts to a chosen homeomorphism
  between them, matching endpoints", propagated through operation 1.
* `def:generated-structure`, operation 1 (edge subdivision) — "the corresponding point is
  inserted into the corresponding edge"; `SubdivData.targetParam` is "corresponding".

Declarations:

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.arcMatch_edge` — the drawn subdivided edge, its image,
  and `g` between them, as an `ArcMatch`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.targetParam` — the corresponding parameter on the target
  side, with `drawing_targetParam`, `targetParam_leftParam`, `targetParam_rightParam`,
  `targetParam_ends`, `targetParam_mem_Ioo`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.realizeHomeo` — the transported skeleton homeomorphism,
  with `realizeHomeo_toFun` / `realizeHomeo_invFun` / `realizeHomeo_eqOn`.
