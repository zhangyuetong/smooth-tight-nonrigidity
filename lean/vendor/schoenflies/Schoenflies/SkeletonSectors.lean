# The sector decomposition of a local disk, and the branches that cut it

`Schoenflies/SkeletonLocal.lean` proves the *radial* half of Lemma "Local structure of a
polygonal skeleton" (`lem:local-skeleton-structure`): a point `x` of a finite polygonal plane
graph has a radius `r` at which the closed disk meets the point set exactly in `x` together with
the radii in the *local directions* `Schoenflies.localDirs`. Two things the blueprint proves are
missing there, and this module supplies them.

## 1. The sectors

"Consequently `B(x,r) \ |G|` is a finite union of open circular sectors" is proved here, in the
form the blueprint states it: the punctured disk is the union, over the **consecutive pairs** of
local directions, of the open sectors between them
(`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_iUnion_cone`), each of which is open, connected,
nonempty and disjoint from the graph. The sector is `Plane.cone x (Plane.arcCCW d w) r`, the
object `Schoenflies/Strip.lean` already builds; nothing new is defined for it. The union is
disjoint (`Schoenflies.cone_disjoint_of_isSectorPair`), so each sector is exactly a connected
component of the punctured disk
(`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.connectedComponentIn_eq_cone`).

"Consecutive" is `Plane.IsSectorPair D d w`: both are in `D`, they are distinct, and no member
of `D` lies strictly inside `arcCCW d w`. **No angle and no sorting is visible in that
definition**, and none is used at a call site. The existence proof does sort, and this is the
piece with no analogue on `main`: read as a *ternary cyclic order*, `Plane.arcCCW` obeys
rotation (`Plane.mem_arcCCW_rotate`), asymmetry (`Plane.notMem_arcCCW_swap`,
`Plane.notMem_arcCCW_asymm`), two transitivity laws (`Plane.arcCCW_trans`,
`Plane.arcCCW_trans'`) and — for genuine directions — totality (`Plane.mem_arcCCW_total`). All
of them are pure sign-of-`det` facts, and the two transitivity laws are one instance each of the
Grassmann identity `Plane.det_mul_det_add`; none of them needs a nondegeneracy hypothesis. Cut
at any direction outside `D` and the cyclic order becomes a linear order; the greatest and the
least element of `D` in it bound the sector containing the cut (`Plane.exists_isSectorPair`).

## 2. The branches

On `main` nothing links `localDirs` to the edges of the graph, so "with pairwise distinct
directions" holds only because a *set* has distinct members. The blueprint derives it, and that
derivation is the mathematical content of the lemma. It is here:

* `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_edge_radial` and `Graph.IsDrawing.edge_radial_unique` — each radial
  segment lies inside exactly one edge arc. The relative interior of the segment is connected
  and contains no vertex, so `Graph.IsDrawing.unique_edge_at` makes "the edge through this
  point" locally constant on it, and the edge arcs being closed and finitely many makes it
  constant.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.not_three_localDirs_on_edge` — one edge carries at most two of them. The
  parametrization of an edge is a continuous injection of a compact interval, hence a closed
  map, so each radial segment pulls back to an *interval* of parameters; three such intervals
  all contain the parameter of `x`, all reach beyond it, and meet pairwise nowhere else, which
  is impossible on a line.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.localDirs_ncard_le` — the two together, counted: there are at most twice as
  many local directions as edges. This is what makes `localDirs` a count of *branches*.

Both steps need a radius at which the disk contains no vertex other than `x`, which
`Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius` does not record and does not imply — a local radius may perfectly
well contain other vertices, sitting out along the radial segments. `Graph.IsLocalDisk` adds
that clause and `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_isLocalDisk` produces it.

## What the consumer gets

`lem:polygonal-side-accessibility` wants, at once: the finitely many sectors, that each is
connected and misses the skeleton, one that meets the prescribed face, and a short straight
segment from `x` into it. `Graph.exists_access_sector` hands over all four about one named
sector, so nothing has to be composed at the call site. The straight segment needs no
shortening: a sector is star-shaped about its apex
(`Schoenflies.openSegment_subset_cone_arcCCW`), so `(x, y)` lies in the very sector `y` is in.

## The two-branch hypothesis

The sector decomposition and `Graph.exists_access_sector` assume that `x` has **at least two**
local directions. That is not cosmetic: with one local direction the complement of the ray in
the disk is a genuine sector of full turn, and `arcCCW d d` is empty, so it is not of the form
`arcCCW d w` for `d, w ∈ localDirs`; with none it is the punctured disk. The
consumer form is `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_access_region`, which returns the connected component
of `y` in the punctured disk — a set with every property of a sector that the accessibility
argument uses, but with no claim that it is bounded by two local directions. Whether the two
degenerate punctured disks are connected is not settled here; it is not needed, because the
component is connected by construction.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.ball_diff_eq_iUnion_cone`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.cone_subset_ball_diff`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.isConnected_cone`, `Schoenflies.isOpen_cone_arcCCW`,
  `Schoenflies.cone_disjoint_of_isSectorPair`,
  `Schoenflies.IsLocalRadius.connectedComponentIn_eq_cone` — "consequently `B(x,r) \ |G|` is a
  finite union of open circular sectors" of `lem:local-skeleton-structure`.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_edge_radial`, `Graph.IsDrawing.edge_radial_unique`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.not_three_localDirs_on_edge`, `Graph.IsDrawing.localDirs_ncard_le` — "two of
  these radial segments with a common direction would have overlapping relative interiors,
  which is impossible", the distinct-directions step of the same lemma.
* `Graph.IsLocalDisk`, `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_isLocalDisk` — the radius `r₀` of the same lemma,
  with the vertex clause the drawing axioms need.
* `Graph.exists_access_sector`, `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_access_region` — "each sector is
  connected and disjoint from the skeleton … at least one sector lies in `F` … a short straight
  segment from `x` into that sector is a polygonal access arc" of
  `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`.
* `Plane.mem_arcCCW_rotate`, `Plane.notMem_arcCCW_swap`, `Plane.arcCCW_trans`,
  `Plane.arcCCW_trans'`, `Plane.mem_arcCCW_total`, `Plane.exists_isSectorPair`,
  `Plane.IsSectorPair.unique` — the cyclic order of finitely many directions.
  `app:background`, item 1 lists the two arcs bounded by two directions but not their cyclic
  order; this is the part of "pairwise distinct directions" that the background package does
  not cover.

/-! ### The cyclic order of directions

`Plane.arcCCW u w` is, by definition, the set of `d` for which at least two of the three
consecutive orientation forms of the triple `(u, d, w)` are positive — Sedgewick's `ccw`
predicate on that triple. Reading it as a *ternary cyclic order* rather than as an arc is what
makes a finite set of directions sortable without an angle: the three lemmas below are exactly
the axioms of a cyclic order (rotation, asymmetry, transitivity), and they hold with no
nondegeneracy hypothesis at all. -/

/-- The Grassmann identity for four vectors of the plane: any three of them are linearly
dependent, and expanding that dependence against the fourth gives this relation among the six
orientation forms. Every transitivity below is one instance of it. -/
theorem det_mul_det_add (a b c e : Plane) :
    det a b * det c e - det a c * det b e + det a e * det b c = 0 := by
  simp only [det]; ring

/-- **Rotation.** The cyclic order is invariant under rotating its triple: `d` lies on the arc
counterclockwise from `u` to `w` exactly when `w` lies on the arc counterclockwise from `d` to
`u`. -/

/-- **Asymmetry.** Transposing the first two entries of the triple negates the cyclic order:
if `v` is counterclockwise of `u` before `w`, then `u` is not counterclockwise of `v` before
`w`. Two of the three orientation forms would have to be positive and two negative. -/

/-! #### The two transitivity laws

Both are the same real-arithmetic fact, extracted so that the `det` bookkeeping happens once.
Write `p₁ = det u w`, `p₂ = det w v`, `p₃ = det v u` for the triple `(u, w, v)`, and
`q₂ = det v d`, `q₃ = det d u` for the missing entries of `(u, v, d)`; note `det u v = -p₃`.
The Grassmann identity turns into `p₃ * s₂ = q₃ * p₂ - p₁ * q₂` with `s₂ = det w d`. -/

/-! ### Consecutive directions, and the sector they bound

A finite set `D` of directions cuts the circle of directions into arcs. A pair `(d, w)` of
members of `D` is *consecutive* when nothing of `D` lies strictly between them: that is the
whole of `Plane.IsSectorPair`, and it is stated with no reference to a sorting of `D`.

The existence proof does sort, but only relative to a *free* direction `u` — one that is not in
`D`. Seen from `u` the cyclic order becomes the linear order `v ≺ w ↔ v ∈ arcCCW u w`, whose
greatest and least elements are the two rays bounding the sector `u` lies in. -/

/-! ## Finite polygonal plane graphs

`Schoenflies/SkeletonLocal.lean` produces a local radius from the *point set* of the graph, and
never looks at the edges. The blueprint's proof does: it derives the pairwise distinctness of
the branch directions from the drawing axioms. That derivation is what follows, and it needs
one more thing from the radius than `IsLocalRadius` records — that the disk contains no vertex
other than `x` — because the drawing axioms only control edges away from the vertices. -/

/-! ### An edge carries at most two local branches

The parametrization of an edge is a continuous injection of a compact interval, hence a closed
map, so the preimage of a connected subset of its arc is connected
(`IsPreconnected.preimage_of_isClosedMap`). Three radial segments inside one edge arc therefore
pull back to three intervals of parameters, each containing the parameter of `x` and a point
other than it, and meeting pairwise in nothing else. Two of the three lie on the same side of
the parameter of `x`, and then the smaller of the two extra points belongs to both intervals. -/
