# Strongly accessible boundary points

A point `p` of the boundary of a region `D` is *strongly accessible* when an open disk
contained in `D` is tangent to the boundary at `p`. Ordinary accessibility (some arc in `D`
ending at `p`) is too weak for the iterative construction: what is wanted at `p` is a definite
wedge of straight segments running into `D`, which can then be shrunk to avoid any compact set
already built.

This module supplies that wedge. The tangent disk `B(q, r)` at `p` is turned into the open
cone `accessCone p v s` of points seen from `p` in a direction within 60 degrees of
`v = (q - p)/r` and at distance less than `s`; the content of Lemma 8.4 is that this cone lies
in the disk as soon as `s ≤ r`, and hence in `D`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.StronglyAccessible` — Definition 8.1 (strong accessibility).
* `Schoenflies.stronglyAccessible_of_isMinOn` — Lemma 8.2 (nearest points are strongly
  accessible).
* `Schoenflies.tangent_cone` — Lemma 8.4 (tangent-disk cone), in the literal form of the
  blueprint; `Schoenflies.accessCone_subset_ball` is the same estimate packaged as the
  inclusion of a truncated cone, which is the form the consumers use.
* `Schoenflies.exists_countable_dense_stronglyAccessible` — Proposition 8.5 (countable dense
  strong-access set).

Lemma 8.3 (density of strongly accessible points) is not formalized here: its proof runs
through `C = ∂D`, i.e. through the Jordan curve theorem, which is not yet available. Its role
is played by Proposition 8.5, which is stated with `C ⊆ closure D` as a hypothesis.

/-! ### Strong accessibility -/

/-- Definition 8.1 (strong accessibility). A point `p` is *strongly accessible* from `D` when
some open disk of positive radius contained in `D` is tangent to `p`, that is, has `p` on its
boundary circle. -/
def StronglyAccessible (D : Set Plane) (p : Plane) : Prop :=
  ∃ (q : Plane) (r : ℝ), 0 < r ∧ dist q p = r ∧ ball q r ⊆ D

/-- Lemma 8.2 (nearest points are strongly accessible). If `a ∈ C` is nearest to a point `q`
off `C`, then the ball of radius `dist q a` around `q` misses `C`; being connected it stays
inside the connected component of `q` in the complement of `C`, so any set `D` containing that
component contains a disk tangent to `C` at `a`.

The hypothesis is phrased as `connectedComponentIn Cᶜ q ⊆ D` rather than as `D` being that
component, so that it can be discharged by an inclusion when `D` is known only up to
containment. No closedness of `C` is needed. -/

/-- The open cone of straight access segments at `p` around the unit direction `v`, truncated
at radius `s`: the points seen from `p` in a direction `w` with `⟪v, w⟫ > 1/2` and at distance
less than `s`. Writing the condition as `‖x - p‖ / 2 < ⟪v, x - p⟫` avoids normalizing `x - p`,
and makes the openness of the cone immediate. -/

/-- Lemma 8.4 (tangent-disk cone), in the form the construction uses. If the disk `B(q, r)` is
tangent at `p`, then the whole truncated cone around `v = (q - p)/r` of any radius `s ≤ r` lies
inside that disk.

The estimate behind it is the blueprint's: for `x` in the cone, with `d = ‖x - p‖`,
`‖x - q‖² = d² - 2⟪x - p, q - p⟫ + r² < d² - rd + r² = r² + d(d - r) < r²`. -/

straight ray from `p` in the direction `w` stays in the disk up to distance `r`. -/

/-! ### A countable dense set of strongly accessible points -/

/-- Proposition 8.5 (countable dense strong-access set). For every rational point of `D` pick a
nearest point of `C`; the chosen points are countably many, all strongly accessible, and dense
in `C`, since a point of `C` is approximated by points of `D` and the nearest point of `C` to
such a `q` is at most `dist q p` from `q`, hence at most `2 * dist q p` from `p`.

The hypothesis `C ⊆ closure D` replaces the blueprint's appeal to `C = ∂D` (Theorem 6.1);
`hDmax` says `D` swallows the connected component in `Cᶜ` of each of its points, which holds
when `D` is such a component. -/
