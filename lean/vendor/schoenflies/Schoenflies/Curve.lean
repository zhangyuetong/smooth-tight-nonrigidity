# Arcs and Jordan curves

A simple arc is the image of an injective continuous map from `[0, 1]`; a Jordan curve is
the image of a map on `[0, 1]` which is injective before it returns to its start. Those are
the blueprint's definitions verbatim.

The parameter domain is a *subset of `ℝ`*, not a type: an arc is carried by an ordinary
`f : ℝ → Plane` together with `ContinuousOn f unitInterval` and `InjOn f unitInterval`.
Mathlib's `Path` bundles a map out of `↥unitInterval` instead, which is the right choice
when paths are to be composed up to homotopy, and the wrong one here: subarcs are taken at
arbitrary parameter pairs, reparametrisation is composition on `ℝ` with nothing to extract,
and a Jordan curve's theorems are all about *its parameters*. Taking the circle as the
domain would need a traversal of the circle by an interval, which is exactly what a
trigonometry-free development does not have.

`IsArcBetween` is the set-level reading — an arc *between two named points* — and is the
form most of the development speaks, since gluing and cutting are stated about endpoints.

## Blueprint

* `IsArc`, `IsJordanCurve` — §1, the definitions of a simple arc and a Jordan curve.
* `IsArcBetween` — an arc between two named points.
* `IsLoop` — the parametrisation underlying a Jordan curve.
