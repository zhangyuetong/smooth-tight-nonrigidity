# Polygonal sets, and segments as arcs

`IsPolygonal` is the blueprint's set-level predicate: a finite union of line segments, which
here is exactly the carrier of some vertex list.

The theorem the plane-graph layer needs from this module is `isArcBetween_segment`: a
*nondegenerate* segment is an arc between its endpoints. It is what makes the drawing
condition free for a polygonal plane graph — an edge's arc obligation is discharged by the
segment itself, and the distinctness of its ends is already part of well-formedness.

## Blueprint

* `IsPolygonal` — §1, "an arc or curve is polygonal if it is a finite union of line segments".
* `isArcBetween_segment` — a nondegenerate segment is an arc between its endpoints.
