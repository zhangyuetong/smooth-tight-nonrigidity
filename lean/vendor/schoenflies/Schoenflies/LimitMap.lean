# The limit homeomorphism of the interiors

The blueprint opens this section with a sentence that is an instruction to the formalizer: "We
now forget how the decompositions were constructed and use only their nesting, matching, and
shrinking properties." This module takes it literally. `LimitTower` is a structure recording
exactly those properties — a sequence of matched cell structures with two realizations each, a
`Realization.Refines` instance between consecutive stages on each side sharing one parent map,
nested skeleton homeomorphisms, and the two shrinking hypotheses of `prop:shrinking-stars` — and
everything from the definition of `F` to `prop:interior-homeomorphism` is proved against it.
Nothing below mentions a mesh, a grid, or a constructor. The still-open construction has to
produce one `LimitTower`; none of the analysis waits for it.

## What is *not* a field

Three things the task list expected to appear as hypotheses turned out to be derivable and are
therefore proved here rather than assumed.

* **`lem:outer-incidence`.** `docs/ROADMAP.md` records it as done in `CombinatorialInvariance.lean`
  under `outerEdge_face_corresponds`; that is a different statement (assertion (vi) of
  `lem:cellulation-invariants`, transported). The real `lem:outer-incidence` — `closure σ` meets
  `C` iff some outer cell is a subcell of `σ` iff `closure σ'` meets `S` — is proved below as
  `Realization.IsCellDecomposition.closure_cell_meets_outer_iff` and, for stars,
  `LimitTower.star_meets_bdry_iff`. The one geometric input it needs is
  `Realization.outerSet_eq_iUnion_cell`: the realized outer cycle is exactly the union of the
  open cells of the outer cells, which is a consequence of the two `Realization` clauses
  `cell_vertex` and `cell_edge` and holds for any subcomplex.
* **Assertion (vii) of `lem:cellulation-invariants`** (every 2-cell boundary a Jordan curve with
  the open cell its bounded region). The limit argument was expected to need it, through
  assertion (viii). It does not: the only use is "a 2-cell is not a proper subcell of a 2-cell",
  and that is `CombInvariants.face_maximal`, which is already an inductive invariant on `main`.
  There is therefore no field for (vii) and no dependency on it.
* **`prop:target-skeleton-dense`.** The blueprint's surjectivity proof goes through the density
  of the target skeleton and a compactness argument in `C ∪ D`. That is not needed: the sets
  `⋂ₙ St_{Γₙ}(car_{Γ'ₙ}(y))` — the *source* stars of the *target* carriers of `y` — are a nested
  sequence of nonempty compacts, and any point of their intersection is already a preimage of
  `y`. `prop:target-skeleton-dense` is proved anyway, because the boundary-continuity module
  cites it, but it is not on the critical path to `prop:F-surjective`.

## The two shrinking hypotheses are not symmetric

`prop:shrinking-stars` gives *pointwise* convergence of the source star diameters and *uniform*
convergence of the target ones. The asymmetry is real and is used: `F` is defined, and continuous,
on the whole closed domain (only the uniform bound enters), whereas injectivity and the continuity
of the inverse hold on the open region (they need the pointwise bound at a point of `D`).

One hypothesis that the blueprint does not state is carried throughout: the closed domains are
bounded. It is not optional — `Metric.diam` is `0` on an unbounded set, so without it the star
diameter bounds are false rather than weak — and it is trivially true for a closed Jordan domain.

## Blueprint

All of the following live in `Schoenflies.CellStructure`.

* `LimitTower` — the abstraction of the head of the section: "we now forget how the
  decompositions were constructed and use only their nesting, matching, and shrinking
  properties".
* The definition of `F` (tex "The limit homeomorphism of the interiors") —
  `LimitTower.F`, with `LimitTower.iInter_tgtStar_eq` its characterisation
  (`lem:nested-compact` applied to the nested stars `LimitTower.tgtStar`),
  `LimitTower.F_mem_tgtStar` and `LimitTower.eq_F_of_mem_iInter`.
* `lem:outer-incidence` — `Realization.IsCellDecomposition.closure_cell_meets_outer_iff` and
  `Realization.IsCellDecomposition.star_meets_outer_iff`, with the matched form the limit
  argument cites, `LimitTower.star_meets_bdry_iff`. Their geometric input is
  `Realization.outerSet_eq_iUnion_cell`.
* `prop:skeleton-agreement` — `LimitTower.F_eq_skelHomeo`.
* `prop:F-continuous` — `LimitTower.continuousOn_F`, on the *closed* domain.
* `prop:image-interior` — `LimitTower.F_mem_region'`.
* `prop:F-injective` — `LimitTower.injOn_F`.
* `prop:target-skeleton-dense` — `LimitTower.exists_mem_tgt_skeletonSet`.
* `prop:F-surjective` — `LimitTower.exists_mem_region_F_eq`, through `LimitTower.preStar` and
  `LimitTower.F_eq_of_mem_iInter_preStar`.
* `lem:exact-cell-correspondence` — `LimitTower.image_cell`, with the corollary the inverse
  argument actually uses, `LimitTower.tgt_carrier_F`.
* `prop:inverse-continuous` — `LimitTower.continuousOn_inv`, on the explicit inverse
  `LimitTower.inv`.
* `prop:interior-homeomorphism` — `LimitTower.isHomeoOn_F` and, with the skeleton clause,
  `LimitTower.interior_homeomorphism`; in the `Schoenflies.IsHomeoOn` shape that `Endgame.lean`
  and the boundary-continuity module consume.
* `lem:cell-neighborhood` is used, not restated: it is
  `Realization.IsCellDecomposition.sub_carrier_of_mem_cellNbhd` in `RefinementStars.lean`, and
  the cross-realization form the limit map needs is
  `LimitTower.tgtStar_subset_of_mem_cellNbhd`.

/-! ### The realized skeleton and outer cycle, cell by cell

`Realization.skeletonSet` and `Realization.outerSet` are defined as point sets of drawn graphs.
The limit argument needs them as unions of *open cells*, because that is the form in which they
interact with `IsCellDecomposition`: "the carrier of any point of `C` is an outer cell" is the
first sentence of the blueprint's proof of `lem:outer-incidence`, and it is exactly this
rewriting. -/

nothing else. The blueprint's "we now forget how the decompositions were constructed" is this
structure.

`str n` is the stage-`n` abstract matched cell structure; `src n` and `tgt n` are its two
realizations, in the closed Jordan domain `dom` and in the closed square `dom'`; `skelHomeo n` is
the stage-`n` skeleton homeomorphism `g_n`. Consecutive stages are related by a pair of
`Realization.Refines` instances **sharing one parent map** `par n` — that sharing is
`lem:refinement-compatibility`(c), "corresponding cells have corresponding parents", under the
representation of `CombinatorialInvariance.lean`, where cells are abstract names.

The shrinking clauses are `prop:shrinking-stars`, and they are deliberately asymmetric, exactly
as the blueprint states them: the *target* star diameters are bounded uniformly by a null
sequence `eps`, while the *source* star diameters are only assumed to tend to zero pointwise, and
only at points of the open region. -/
