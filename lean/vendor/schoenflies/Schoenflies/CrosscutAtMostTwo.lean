# A crosscut cuts a region into at most two pieces

Lemma "At most two sides": if `D` is a region and `P` is a simple polygonal arc whose endpoints
lie *outside* `D` and whose remaining points lie in `D`, then `D ∖ P` has at most two
components. This is the missing half of the crosscut theorem — the crosscut-cells lemma
(`Schoenflies.crosscut_cells`) already exhibits two components, and this says there are no
others.

## "At most two" as a covering statement

Nothing here talks about the *set* of components. What is proved, and what the crosscut theorem
consumes, is the constructive form: two points `z_L, z_R` of `D ∖ P` such that every point of
`D ∖ P` lies in the component of one of them (`crosscut_at_most_two`). Handed two components
that are known to be distinct — which is exactly what the crosscut-cells lemma supplies — that
turns into "every point lies in one of *those* two" (`crosscut_components_exhaust`), which is
the sentence the crosscut theorem actually needs.

## The proof is a clopen argument, not the blueprint's path argument

The blueprint traces a polygonal arc `γ` from an arbitrary `x ∈ D ∖ P` to a reference point
`z₀ ∈ P`, takes the first point `z` of `γ` on `P`, and pushes `x` into a track of a strip around
the subarc of `P` from `z` to `z₀`. The first-hitting-point step is only there to *find* a point
of `D ∖ P` next to `P`; once one knows that a whole neighbourhood of every point of `P ∩ D` is
covered by the two components, the statement is a connectedness argument and no path is needed:

* `T`, the set of points of `D ∖ P` in neither of the two components, is open, because a
  component of an open subset of the plane is open and two components are equal or disjoint
  (`isOpen_notMem_two_components`);
* `U`, the union of the two components with every open piece of `D` whose complement of `P` is
  covered, is open and contains all of `P ∩ D`;
* `U` and `T` are disjoint, cover `D`, and `U` meets `D`; so `T = ∅` because `D` is connected.

That is `covered_by_two_of_local`, and it is where "at most two" really comes from. The arc, the
polygonality and the endpoint hypotheses enter only through the collar.

## The collar is a hypothesis: `Schoenflies/Strip.lean` is stated for a closed curve

The local input the argument needs is blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b) — a two-sided collar of a compact
subarc of `P ∖ ∂P`. `Schoenflies/Strip.lean`, `Schoenflies/StripLocal.lean` and
`Schoenflies/Compose.lean` build the collar of a `ClosedPolygon`, a *closed* curve, and the note
at the end of `StripLocal.lean` says in as many words that the arc case "is not formalised".
There is no way to get it from the closed case: the two tracks of a closed collar are connected
because they run all the way round the curve, and intersecting them with `D` destroys exactly
that.

So `HasArcCollars D P` is an explicit hypothesis of every theorem below. It is blueprint
Lemma 1.8 (b) with the prescribed open set taken to be `D`, together with the "local sides"
clause of that lemma in the form `StripLocal.lean` already proves in the closed case
(`StripData.carrier_subset_closure_sideL`): every point of the subarc is in the closure of both
tracks. `ArcCollar` is the bundled datum, so a discharger returns a construction rather than an
existential.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.ArcCollar`, `Schoenflies.HasArcCollars` — Lemma 1.8 (b) (two-sided polygonal
  strips, the arc case) as an interface: the collar of one compact subarc as data, and the
  hypothesis that every compact subarc has one.
* `Schoenflies.isOpen_notMem_two_components`, `Schoenflies.covered_by_two_of_local` — the clopen
  step, which is the whole of the lemma once the collar is available.
* `Schoenflies.crosscut_at_most_two` — Lemma "At most two sides".
* `Schoenflies.crosscut_components_exhaust` — the same, applied to two components already known
  to be distinct; this is the form Theorem "Crosscut theorem" cites.
* `Schoenflies.Plane.mem_segment_iff_coord`, `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars_segment` — Lemma 1.8 (b)
  for a straight crosscut, which is the blueprint's edge block and nothing else. With it,
  `Schoenflies.segment_crosscut_at_most_two` is Lemma "At most two sides" for a straight
  crosscut with no hypothesis left standing, and certifies that `HasArcCollars` is satisfiable.

/-! ### The collar of a compact subarc, as data

Blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b). `nbhd` is the neighbourhood `N`, `left` and `right` are the two tracks
`N_L, N_R`. The prescribed open set of the blueprint is `D`, which is all this development ever
prescribes.

Two clauses of the blueprint are dropped because nothing here uses them: that the tracks are
open and that they are disjoint. Two are kept and are essential: that each track is *connected*
— that is the whole point of a collar, and it is what ties the local picture at one point of the
arc to the local picture at another — and that every point of the subarc is in the closure of
both tracks, which is the blueprint's "the two sets `N_L, N_R` are the two local sides of the
curve" in the form `StripLocal.lean` proves it for a closed polygon. -/

/-- A **two-sided collar** of the compact subarc `K` of `P`, inside the region `D`: an open
neighbourhood `nbhd` of `K` contained in `D`, whose complement of `P` splits into two connected
tracks, each of which approaches every point of `K`.

Note that the splitting clause is stated for `nbhd ∖ P` and not for `nbhd ∖ K`: an open
neighbourhood of `K` necessarily contains points of `P` beyond the ends of `K`, and it is the
*whole* of `P` that has to be removed for the tracks to lie in `D ∖ P`. That is how the
blueprint states it too. -/

/-- **Blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b) as a hypothesis.** Every nondegenerate compact connected piece of
`P` lying inside `D` has a two-sided collar inside `D`.

A compact connected subset of an arc is a compact subarc, so this is the blueprint's "if `P` is
an arc and `K` is a compact subarc of `P ∖ ∂P`" — the condition `K ⊆ D ∩ P` is what "`K` avoids
the endpoints" amounts to here, since the endpoints of a crosscut are outside `D`.

Nondegeneracy is asked for because the blueprint's proof builds the collar out of edge blocks
and vertex disks along `K`, which needs `K` to contain an edge; a consumer that has a genuine
subarc always has it. -/

/-- **Lemma "At most two sides".** Let `D` be a region and `P` a simple polygonal arc whose
endpoints `a, b` lie outside `D` and whose remaining points lie in `D`. Then there are two
points `z_L, z_R` of `D ∖ P` such that every point of `D ∖ P` lies in the component of one of
them — that is, `D ∖ P` has at most two components.

`IsPolygonal P` is carried because the blueprint statement carries it, and because it is what
makes `HasArcCollars` discharge­able; this proof does not use it, since all the geometry is
inside the collar.

The reference points are the two reference points of the collar of the middle third of the arc:
`K₀ = f '' [1/4, 3/4]` for a parametrisation `f` of `P`. Any other nondegenerate compact subarc
would do, and `ArcCollar.nbhd_diff_subset_components` is stated so that a consumer that has a
collar of its own can use *its* reference points instead. -/

/-! ### The collar hypothesis is not vacuous: a straight crosscut

The collar of a *straight* crosscut is a rectangle, and the free-standing frame toolkit of
`Schoenflies/Strip.lean` — `coordAlong`, `coordAcross`, `strip`, `isOpen_strip`, `convex_strip`,
`dist_foot`, `frame_decomp` — builds it directly, with no cyclic vertex family in sight. So
`HasArcCollars` is discharged outright in the simplest crosscut configuration, and
`segment_crosscut_at_most_two` below is a hypothesis-free instance of the lemma.

This is the shape a general discharger has to reproduce along a chain of edges: it is exactly
the blueprint's edge block, and what is missing is the vertex disks between consecutive blocks
and the end cross-sections. -/

/-- A nondegenerate segment has a unit direction and a length: `L • u = b - a` with `‖u‖ = 1`.

Stated as an existential so that the direction and the length are *opaque* to the consumer.
Writing them as `dir (b - a)` and `‖b - a‖` makes every subsequent rewrite of `b` reach inside
them, which is exactly the friction the strip apparatus avoids by carrying `tang` and `len` as
fields. -/

/-- **A straight crosscut has two-sided collars.** For a nondegenerate segment whose endpoints
lie outside the region and whose remaining points lie inside, blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b) is a
rectangle: an open block around the subarc, of half-width small enough to stay inside the
region, split by the line of the segment into two convex halves.

This discharges `HasArcCollars` in the one case the existing strip apparatus reaches without an
arc collar being built, and so certifies that the hypothesis of `crosscut_at_most_two` is
satisfiable. -/
