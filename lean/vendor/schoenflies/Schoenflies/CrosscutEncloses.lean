# `thm:polygonal-crosscut` at the level of sets, and the geometric half of the outer-chain descent

The blueprint sentence this module discharges is one line of the proof of `lem:outer-chain`:

> The path `R` lies on one side of `C` and is a crosscut there. By `thm:polygonal-crosscut`,
> exactly one of the two cycles `R ∪ C₁`, `R ∪ C₂` encloses `x`.

`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` of `Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean` is that sentence weakened to *at least*
one, which is all the descent uses; the weakening is not undone here.

## One theorem, no case split

The blueprint — and the note in `Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean` — distinguishes the crosscut running
inside `C` (settled by `Schoenflies.crosscutSplitsRegion`) from the crosscut running outside it
(`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut.inside_exactly_one`). **Neither case distinction is needed.**
Both are consequences of Lemma 2.7, the parity identity

    π_{A₁ ∪ P} + π_{A₂ ∪ P} = π_J        at *every* point of the plane,

which holds with no geometry whatever (`Schoenflies.parity_split`), together with the *one*
direction of Theorem 2.3 that needs no realization of the two spliced curves:

    a closed chain whose cover separates has crossing count `0` on the unbounded region

(`Schoenflies.parity_eq_zero_of_mem_outside_cover`). If `x` were outside both spliced curves the
identity would read `0 + 0 = π_J(x)`, whereas `π_J(x) = 1` because `x` is inside `J`. That is the
whole proof of `Schoenflies.crosscut_inside_at_least_one`, and it is uniform in which side the
crosscut runs on. The `ClosedPolygon`-level `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut.inside_exactly_one`,
whose `SameEdges` hypotheses cannot be met at graph vertices (see the section docstring of
`Schoenflies/FaceCyclesLand.lean`), is therefore not used at all.

The price is that the conclusion is "at least one" rather than "exactly one": the converse
direction of Theorem 2.3 for the spliced curves — `π = 1` forces the bounded region — *does* need
them realized, and the descent does not want it.

## The set-level statement is the artefact

`Schoenflies.crosscut_inside_at_least_one` takes sets and arcs, not polygons and not graphs:

    `J` a polygonal Jordan curve, `A₁, A₂` arcs from `p` to `q` covering it, `P` a polygonal arc
    from `p` to `q` meeting `J` only at `p, q`; then a point inside `J` and off `P` is inside
    `A₁ ∪ P` or inside `A₂ ∪ P`.

That is `thm:polygonal-crosscut` in the shape every plane-graph consumer wants, and
`Graph.crosscutEnclosesOff` is a two-page corollary of it. A second general fact falls out on the
way: `Schoenflies.two_arcs_inter_of_union` — two arcs with the same ends that cover a Jordan curve
meet **exactly** at those ends. That removes the "the two arcs meet only at the cut points" clause
from every consumer's obligations, which matters here because `Graph.IsCycleCrosscut` does not
record it (see below).

## Two defects of the interface handed to this module — read before integrating

**1. `Graph.CrosscutEncloses` as stated on `main` is false**, and the deliverable is
`Graph.CrosscutEnclosesOff`, which is it plus one hypothesis: `x ∈ exterior H drawing`. Nothing in
`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` prevents `x` from lying **on the crosscut's own drawing**: `x` is only
assumed to be inside the cycle `C`, and a crosscut running inside `C` may pass through `x`. Then
`x ∈ (A₁ ∪ P) ∩ (A₂ ∪ P)`, so `x` is inside neither spliced curve and the conclusion fails.

**The repair costs the chain nothing.** `Graph.OuterOnPairs` already puts `x` off the whole chain
(`Graph.IsPlaneChain.mem_exterior_chain`), and every block lies inside the chain
(`Graph.pointSet_mono`), so the clause can be produced where it is needed instead of being carried.
`Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscutOff` below therefore proves `Graph.Descent` **exactly as it
stands on `main`**, and `Graph.IsPlaneChain.outer_chain_of_crosscutExists` is `lem:outer-chain` with
`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` discharged outright. Nothing in `Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean` has to
change; `Graph.CrosscutEncloses` should simply be deleted, together with
`Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscut` and `Graph.IsPlaneChain.outer_chain_of_crosscut`, which the
two theorems here replace.

**2. `Graph.IsCycleCrosscut` does not record that the two arcs meet only at the two cut points**,
although `Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at` — the theorem that builds them — produces exactly that
clause. It is not needed here, because `Schoenflies.two_arcs_inter_of_union` recovers the geometric
consequence from the Jordan curve; but a consumer that wants the *combinatorial* statement will
have to add the field.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.two_arcs_inter_of_union` — §1: two arcs with the same ends covering a Jordan curve
  meet exactly at those ends. General; belongs beside `Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique` in
  `Schoenflies/Realization.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.crosscut_inside_at_least_one` — **`thm:polygonal-crosscut`**, at the level of sets:
  a point inside the curve and off the crosscut is inside one of the two spliced curves.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.mem_edgesCover_of_mem_walkVertices` — the converse of
  `Graph.IsDrawing.mem_walkVertices_of_mem_edgesCover`; general, belongs in
  `Schoenflies/Graph/CycleJordan.lean`.
* `Graph.CrosscutEnclosesOff`, `Graph.crosscutEnclosesOff` — the geometric half of the descent
  step of `lem:outer-chain`: `Graph.CrosscutEncloses` with the missing hypothesis restored,
  **proved**.
* `Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscutOff` — `Graph.Descent` from `Graph.CrosscutExists` alone;
  a drop-in replacement for `Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscut`.
* `Graph.IsPlaneChain.outer_chain_of_crosscutExists` — **`lem:outer-chain`**, assuming only the
  combinatorial half `Graph.CrosscutExists`.

/-! ## Two arcs that cover a Jordan curve meet at their ends

`Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique_of_isClosed` identifies a *given* two-arc splitting with any other
splitting whose two pieces are known to meet exactly at the two points. What a graph consumer has
is weaker: two arcs of a cycle whose union is the whole curve, with nothing said about their
intersection. This lemma supplies the intersection, by comparing with the splitting that
`Schoenflies.IsJordanCurve.two_arcs` produces out of nothing. -/

/-- **Two arcs with the same ends that cover a Jordan curve meet exactly at those ends.**

The proof is the `key` step of `Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique_of_isClosed` run against the reference
splitting: an arc from `p` to `q` inside the curve has connected complement-of-endpoints, so it
lands in one piece of any splitting whose two pieces meet exactly at `p, q`; the two arcs cannot
land in the same piece, since the other piece would then be just `{p, q}`; and once they land in
different pieces they exhaust them. -/

/-! ## `thm:polygonal-crosscut` at the level of sets

The statement a plane-graph consumer wants: sets and arcs, no polygon presentation anywhere in the
hypotheses, and the two spliced curves named by the literal unions `Aᵢ ∪ P`. -/

/-- **The polygonal crosscut theorem, at the level of sets.** `J` is a polygonal Jordan curve, cut
by the two points `p, q` into the arcs `A₁, A₂`; `P` is a polygonal arc from `p` to `q` meeting `J`
in nothing but `p` and `q`. Then a point inside `J` and off `P` lies inside at least one of the two
spliced curves `A₁ ∪ P`, `A₂ ∪ P`.

Nothing is assumed about which side of `J` the crosscut runs on; the proof does not distinguish the
two cases of the blueprint. Nor is `A₁ ∩ A₂ = {p, q}` assumed — it is derived, by
`Schoenflies.two_arcs_inter_of_union`.

The route: present `J` as a `Schoenflies.PrePolygon` with `p` and `q` among its vertices
(`Schoenflies.exists_prePolygon_split`), identify the two given arcs with the two arcs of that
presentation (`Schoenflies.two_arcs_unique_of_isClosed`), and read the parity identity
`π_{A₁ ∪ P} + π_{A₂ ∪ P} = π_J` (`Schoenflies.parity_split`) at the point. Were the point outside
both spliced curves both left-hand terms would vanish
(`Schoenflies.parity_eq_zero_of_mem_outside_cover`, which needs no realization of `Aᵢ ∪ P`),
while the right-hand side is `1` because the point is inside `J`. -/

`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` of `Schoenflies/OuterChain.lean`, plus the hypothesis it is missing. -/

/-- **`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` with the clause it is missing**: `x` is off the drawing of `H`.

Without it the statement is false — see the module docstring. `Graph.CrosscutEncloses` puts `x`
inside the cycle `C` and nothing more, so a crosscut running inside `C` may pass through `x`; then
`x` lies on both spliced curves and is inside neither. Everything else is
`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` verbatim, so that the substitution into
`Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscut` is mechanical once `Graph.Descent` carries the same
clause. -/

/-- **The geometric half of the descent step of `lem:outer-chain`.** "The path `R` lies on one side
of `C` and is a crosscut there; by `thm:polygonal-crosscut`, exactly one of the two cycles
`R ∪ C₁`, `R ∪ C₂` encloses `x`" — weakened to *at least* one, and with `x` required to be off the
drawing.

Everything geometric is `Schoenflies.crosscut_inside_at_least_one`; what happens here is the
translation of the graph data into its hypotheses. The two arcs of the cycle are arcs of the plane
by `Graph.IsDrawing.path_isArcBetween`, they cover the cycle's realisation because their edge lists
do, and they meet exactly at the two cut points by `Schoenflies.two_arcs_inter_of_union` — which is
why `Graph.IsCycleCrosscut` gets away with not recording that. That the crosscut meets the cycle
only at its ends is the `edges_new` and `interior` clauses read through
`Graph.IsDrawing.edge_inter`. -/

/-! ## `lem:outer-chain` needs only the combinatorial half now

The extra hypothesis of `Graph.CrosscutEnclosesOff` does **not** have to be threaded through
`Graph.Descent`: the chain hypothesis `Graph.OuterOnPairs` already puts `x` off the whole chain
(`Graph.IsPlaneChain.mem_exterior_chain`), and every block of the chain lies inside it. So the
repair costs the interface nothing at all — `Graph.Descent` is used here exactly as it stands on
`main`, and the two theorems below are drop-in replacements for
`Graph.IsPlaneChain.descent_of_crosscut` and `Graph.IsPlaneChain.outer_chain_of_crosscut` with
`Graph.CrosscutEncloses` discharged. -/
