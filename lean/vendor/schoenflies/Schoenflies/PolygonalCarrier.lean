# Polygonal connectedness over a carrier

`Schoenflies.exists_poly_of_isPreconnected` joins two points of an *open* connected subset
of the plane by a polygonal path. The redrawing argument needs the same conclusion for a
carrier that is **not** open in the plane: the ambient set there is the plane minus finitely
many open squares, and the basic neighbourhood of a point on a square's boundary is a
half-disk or a three-quarter disk rather than a ball.

This module restates the clopen argument over an arbitrary carrier `C`. The only hypothesis
on `C` is that it is *locally polygonally connected*: every point has a relatively open
neighbourhood all of whose points it reaches by a polygonal path inside `C`. Openness of `C`
is used nowhere; the ball of the classical proof appears only in
`isLocallyPolyConnected_of_isOpen`, which is what recovers the old statement.

## Blueprint

Brick B6 of `lem:polygonal-redrawing` (H6): polygonal connectivity one level up.

* `PolyReaches` — "joined by a polygonal path inside `C`", as an inductive relation.
  **Note for the integrator:** `Schoenflies/LocallyPolygonal.lean` is being written
  concurrently and defines a relation of the same meaning; the two want unifying.
* `IsLocallyPolyConnected` — the hypothesis replacing openness.
* `PolyReaches.of_isPreconnected` — Lemma 1.1 (polygonal connectedness) over a carrier.
* `exists_poly_of_isPreconnected'` — the old `exists_poly_of_isPreconnected` re-derived from
  it, verbatim; the `example` below it is a machine check that the statements agree.

/-- `PolyReaches C x y`: there is a polygonal path from `x` to `y` all of whose segments lie
in `C`. Built at the far end — a path is extended by one segment at a time — because that is
the shape both halves of the clopen argument use. `refl` carries `x ∈ C` so that a constant
path witnesses membership, matching `poly [x] = {x}`. -/

its polygon inside `C`. This is `poly_concat` used once per `step`. -/

/-! ### Local polygonal connectedness -/

/-- `C` is locally polygonally connected when every point of `C` has a relatively open
neighbourhood in `C` each of whose points it reaches by a polygonal path inside `C`.

The neighbourhood is presented as `V ∩ C` for an ambient open `V`, which is exactly what a
relatively open neighbourhood is; the paths are only required to stay inside `C`, not inside
the neighbourhood, since that is all the clopen argument uses and it is the weaker demand on
a producer. Ball, half-disk and three-quarter disk all qualify. -/
def IsLocallyPolyConnected (C : Set Plane) : Prop :=
  ∀ w ∈ C, ∃ V : Set Plane, IsOpen V ∧ w ∈ V ∧ ∀ z ∈ V ∩ C, PolyReaches C w z

/-- The relative-openness step, stated once because the clopen argument uses it twice — for
the reachable set and, run backwards, for its relative complement.

A subset of `C` closed under "reach one more point of `C` by a polygonal path" is relatively
open in `C`. The witness is the union of all ambient open sets that are polygonally attached
to a point of `S`; no choice is needed to assemble it. -/

/-! ### The theorem -/

/-- Lemma 1.1 (polygonal connectedness) over a carrier: in a relatively connected, locally
polygonally connected set, any two points are joined by a polygonal path inside the set.

The proof is the clopen argument. The points reachable from `x` are relatively open in `C`,
and so are the unreachable ones — the same lemma, since "unreachable" is stable under
reaching too, by symmetry. `IsPreconnected C` then forbids the split. -/
