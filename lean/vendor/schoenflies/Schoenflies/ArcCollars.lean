# Two-sided collars along a simple polygonal arc

`Schoenflies/CrosscutAtMostTwo.lean` proves Lemma "At most two sides" assuming
`Schoenflies.HasArcCollars`: every compact piece of `D ∩ P` has a two-sided collar inside `D`.
This module discharges that hypothesis for a polygonal arc presented by its vertex list.

## The route: a linear chain, not a cyclic one

`Schoenflies/Strip.lean` builds the collar of blueprint Lemma 1.8 for a `ClosedPolygon`, whose
vertex family is indexed by `ZMod (m + 3)`. The apparatus is redone here on a *linear* index —
route (A) of the three the blueprint's arc case admits. Closing the arc into a polygon (route
(B)) was rejected: it needs a return path from one end of the arc back to the other meeting the
arc only at its ends, and producing one is the two-sided collar of the arc all over again.

Two things change from the cyclic case, and both make the arc case *easier*.

* **There are no sectors at the two extreme vertices.** An edge block already stops short of
  both of its endpoints by the trim `lam`, so the collar of the whole chain of blocks is an open
  neighbourhood of the arc minus two small end caps — which is all that is wanted, because the
  compact piece `K` sits at positive distance from the two endpoints of a crosscut (they are
  outside `D` and `K` is inside).
* **The neighbourhood is open by construction.** The collar of a closed polygon has to contain
  the curve, so `StripData.nbhd` is a union of open sets *plus the carrier*, and
  `StripData.nbhd_eq` is needed to see that it is open. Here `nbhd` is defined outright as the
  union of the vertex balls and the edge tubes; it contains the arc only away from its two ends,
  and there is nothing to prove.

What does **not** change is the germ argument at a corner: `Plane.germs_split'` is applied
exactly as in the cyclic case, with the incoming ray at vertex `i + 1` written `A.back i` and
the outgoing one `A.tang (i + 1)`.

## The one thing left open

`PolyArc` is a *presentation*: a simple polygonal arc given by its vertex list, exactly as
`ClosedPolygon` presents a simple closed polygonal curve. Everything is proved for a `PolyArc`,
and `Schoenflies.polyArc_crosscut_at_most_two` is Lemma "At most two sides" for one with no
hypothesis left standing at all. What is *not* proved is the converse presentation statement:
that a set which happens to be a simple polygonal arc is the carrier of some `PolyArc`. That is
the arc analogue of `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon`, which `Schoenflies/Realization.lean`
proves for a Jordan curve; it is normalisation, not geometry.
`Schoenflies.hasArcCollars` therefore carries it as the hypothesis
`Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier`. See the note at the end of the file for the route.

The presentation is checked in both other directions, so neither the structure nor the
hypothesis is vacuous or accidentally false: `Schoenflies.PolyArc.isArcBetween_carrier` and
`Schoenflies.PolyArc.isPolygonal_carrier` say the carrier of a `PolyArc` *is* a simple polygonal
arc, and `Schoenflies.isPolyArcCarrier_segment` exhibits one.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.PolyArc` — a simple polygonal arc presented by its vertex list; the arc analogue
  of `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon`.
* `Schoenflies.ArcStrip` — the constants of blueprint Lemma 1.8 (b), as a structure: the cone
  radius `R`, the trim `lam`, the half-width `rho`, and the separations they satisfy. The arc
  analogue of `Schoenflies.StripData`, with the two clauses that make the collar fit inside the
  prescribed region and clear of the two endpoints.
* `Schoenflies.ArcStrip.nbhd`, `.sideL`, `.sideR` — the collar `N` and its two tracks `N_L`,
  `N_R` of Lemma 1.8 (b).
* `Schoenflies.ArcStrip.nbhd_diff_carrier`, `.isConnected_sideL`, `.isConnected_sideR`,
  `.sideL_disjoint_sideR`, `.subset_closure_sideL`, `.subset_closure_sideR` — the clauses of
  Lemma 1.8 (b).
* `Schoenflies.exists_arcStrip` — the constants exist. The arc analogue of
  `Schoenflies.exists_stripData_subset`.
* `Schoenflies.ArcStrip.collar`, `Schoenflies.PolyArc.exists_arcCollar`,
  `Schoenflies.PolyArc.hasArcCollars` — Lemma 1.8 (b) itself, as the interface
  `Schoenflies.ArcCollar` that `Schoenflies/CrosscutAtMostTwo.lean` consumes.
* `Schoenflies.PolyArc.isArcBetween_carrier`, `Schoenflies.PolyArc.isPolygonal_carrier` — the
  carrier of a `PolyArc` is a simple polygonal arc between its two extreme vertices.
* `Schoenflies.polyArc_crosscut_at_most_two`,
  `Schoenflies.polyArc_crosscut_components_exhaust` — Lemma "At most two sides" for a polygonal
  arc presented by a vertex list, with no further assumptions.
* `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars`, `Schoenflies.crosscut_at_most_two_of_polyArc`,
  `Schoenflies.crosscut_components_exhaust_of_polyArc` — the same for a *set* `P` presented by
  `Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier`.
* `Schoenflies.segmentPolyArc`, `Schoenflies.isPolyArcCarrier_segment` — a straight crosscut as
  a `PolyArc`, which recovers `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars_segment` as a special case.

/-! ## Simple polygonal arcs

A polygonal arc is presented by its vertex list `v 0, …, v (n + 1)`; its edges are the `n + 1`
segments `edge i = [v i, v (i + 1)]` for `i ≤ n`, and its *interior* vertices — the ones that
carry a corner, and hence a sector of the collar — are `v 1, …, v n`.

The vertex function is indexed by all of `ℕ` and asked to be injective outright, rather than
injective on `{0, …, n + 1}`. Nothing past `v (n + 1)` is ever looked at except through
`A.tang i` and `A.len i`, which are only well behaved when `v i ≠ v (i + 1)`; asking for global
injectivity buys that for free and removes an `i ≤ n` side condition from every lemma about the
edge frame. It costs a discharger nothing: a finite vertex list is padded to an injective
sequence by any tail of fresh points. -/

/-! ## The constants

`ArcStrip` is the arc analogue of `Schoenflies.StripData`: the blueprint's "choose the blocks so
that consecutive ones overlap and nonadjacent closures are disjoint", with every constant named.
Three fields have no counterpart in the closed case, and they are what makes the collar a collar
*of `K` inside `D`*: `ball_subset` and `tube_subset` put every piece inside the prescribed open
set, and `sep_ends` keeps `K` clear of the two ends of the arc, where the collar has no pieces.

`sep_ends` is not a restriction in the intended application: the two endpoints of a crosscut lie
outside `D` and `K` lies inside, so the distance from `K` to either endpoint is positive and `R`
is chosen below it. -/

/-! ## Choosing the constants

The blueprint's own recipe, in the blueprint's order, with the two clauses about the prescribed
open set folded in at the step where they can be met.

1. `R` from the edge lengths, the pairwise vertex separations, the distance from each vertex to
   each nonincident edge, the openness of `D` at each interior vertex, and the distance from `K`
   to the two endpoints of the arc.
2. `lam := R / 5`, which gives `2 lam < R` and, through `R ≤ len i`, also `4 lam < len i`.
3. `rho` from the distance of each *trimmed* edge to every other edge, from the germ threshold
   at every interior vertex, and from the compact separation of each trimmed edge from the
   complement of `D`. Step 3 is where "the collar is inside `D`" is really paid for: a trimmed
   core is a compact subset of `D`, because the only points of the arc outside `D` are its two
   endpoints and the trim removes them. -/

/-! ## The presentation is faithful: the carrier is a simple polygonal arc

`PolyArc` is a *presentation*, so the interface owes a check in the other direction: that the
carrier of a `PolyArc` really is a simple polygonal arc between its two extreme vertices. Both
halves are an induction along the chain of edges, and the only input is simplicity: consecutive
edges meet exactly at the vertex they share, and nonconsecutive ones not at all.

With them, Lemma "At most two sides" for an arc presented by a vertex list has **no hypothesis
left standing** — `Schoenflies.polyArc_crosscut_at_most_two`. -/

/-! ## The presentation is not vacuous: a straight crosscut

A nondegenerate segment is a `PolyArc 0`: one edge, no interior vertex, so both `edges_meet` and
`corner` are vacuous. The vertex function is padded past the segment by walking on in the same
direction, which keeps it injective — this is the padding convention the structure's docstring
describes, in its simplest instance. With it, `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars_segment` of
`Schoenflies/CrosscutAtMostTwo.lean` is a special case of `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars`, which
certifies that `Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier` is satisfiable and that the whole apparatus above
is not vacuous. -/

## What is still missing

Exactly one thing: `Schoenflies.IsPolyArcCarrier`. Everything above is proved for an arc
*presented by its vertex list*, and `Schoenflies.hasArcCollars` therefore carries that
presentation as a hypothesis in place of the blueprint's set-level "`P` is a simple polygonal
arc" (`IsArcBetween P a b` together with `IsPolygonal P`).

The missing theorem is

```
theorem isPolyArcCarrier_of_isPolygonal {P : Set Plane} {a b : Plane}
    (hP : IsArcBetween P a b) (hpoly : IsPolygonal P) (hab : a ≠ b) : IsPolyArcCarrier P a b
```

the arc analogue of `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon`, which `Schoenflies/Realization.lean`
proves for a Jordan curve. It is a *normalisation* statement, not geometry: it says a set that
happens to be both an arc and a finite union of segments can be cut into a chain. The route is
the one `Schoenflies/Realization.lean` takes in the closed case, and its three steps are:

1. `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.exists_poly_eq` already gives a vertex list `vs` with
   `poly vs = P`, `vs.head = a`, `vs.getLast = b`. That list may backtrack: nothing yet says its
   vertices occur in order along `P`.
2. Order them. Each segment `[vs i, vs (i+1)]` is contained in `P` and is an arc between its
   ends, so by `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.eq_of_subset` it *is* the subarc of `P` between the two
   parameters. The parameters of the `vs i`, sorted and deduplicated, therefore cut `[0, 1]` into
   intervals each of which is covered by one of those segments, and the subarc over each is a
   segment. That is the chain, with `vertex_inj` and `edges_meet` immediate from injectivity of
   the parametrisation.
3. Delete redundant vertices, i.e. merge two consecutive collinear edges into one. This is the
   blueprint's own first sentence ("Delete redundant vertices at which two consecutive edges are
   collinear") and is what `corner` needs; the closed-curve analogue is
   `Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_closedPolygon_of_prePolygon`.

None of the three is formalised for an arc. The remaining results require no such interface.
