# Parity splitting: a crosscut adds the two crossing counts

Lemma 2.7. A crosscut `P` of a simple closed polygon `C` cuts it into two arcs `A₁, A₂`, and
the two closed curves `Jᵢ = Aᵢ ∪ P` satisfy `π_C = π_{J₁} + π_{J₂}` off `C ∪ P`. The blueprint
calls this identity "the whole of the polygonal crosscut theorem": Lemma 2.6 exhibits two cells
of `Ω ∖ P`, and this is what says there are no others.

## Where the split is made, and why

The crossing count of `Schoenflies/Parity.lean` is a function of a `List Piece`, not of a set,
and not of a `ClosedPolygon`. Two edge lists with the same carrier can have different parity —
a list that traverses one segment twice is the obvious example — so the identity cannot be
stated for the sets `Aᵢ ∪ P`. It is stated, and proved, for **edge lists**:

    the edge list of `C` is `A₁ ++ A₂`, that of `Jᵢ` is `Aᵢ ++ K`,

where `K` is the edge list of the crosscut. Then `π_{J₁} + π_{J₂} = π_{A₁} + π_{A₂} + 2 π_K`
and the crosscut's contribution cancels mod `2`. That is `parity_split`, and it needs no
geometry at all — no simplicity, no direction, no separation. Everything the blueprint's
picture contributes is in the *hypothesis* that the lists decompose that way.

Two mismatches between "the edge list of `Jᵢ` is `Aᵢ` together with `K`" and literal list
equality have to be absorbed, because a consumer building `Jᵢ` as a `ClosedPolygon` controls
neither:

* the edges come in some cyclic order of that polygon's own choosing, and
* one of the two curves must traverse the crosscut backwards, so its pieces are the *reversed*
  pairs.

`SameEdges` is the equivalence that forgives exactly these two: a permutation of the lists
after each piece has been put in canonical order by `Schoenflies.orientPiece`. Parity, carrier,
closedness and non-levelness are all invariant under it (`SameEdges.parity_eq`,
`SameEdges.cover_eq`, `SameEdges.isChainFrom`, `SameEdges.hgt_ne`), so a consumer may hand over
its edge list in whatever order and orientation it happens to have —
`sameEdges_of_perm_reverse_swap` absorbs both mismatches in one step.

Nothing is assumed about the *sets*: `ClosedPolygon.carrier_eq_of_sameEdges` derives
`Jᵢ.carrier = Aᵢ ∪ P` from the edge lists alone, so the geometric hypothesis a consumer has to
discharge is only ever combinatorial.

## The construction

`ClosedPolygon.arcPieces C a k` is the edge list of the arc of `C` that leaves vertex `a` and
runs forward through `k` edges — the object the split produces, exported as an object rather
than hidden behind an existential. Its two governing facts are

* `ClosedPolygon.arcPieces_split_perm`: `arcPieces C a k ++ arcPieces C (a + k) (m + 3 - k)` is
  a permutation of `C.pieces` — the arcs really do partition the edges; and
* `ClosedPolygon.isChainFrom_arcPieces`: the arc's mod-`2` boundary is its two end vertices,
  which is what makes `Aᵢ ++ K` a *closed* chain and hence eligible for every parity theorem.

`IsChainFrom` is the open-path companion of `Schoenflies.IsClosedChain`, stated by the same
duality; `IsChainFrom.isClosedChain_append` is the one-line reason that an arc and a crosscut
with the same two ends close up. `pathPieces` turns a polyline into such a chain, which is how
the crosscut itself is normally presented.

The endpoints of the crosscut are taken to be **vertices** of `C`; the blueprint's opening
move, "subdivide `C` at `p` and `q`", is what puts them there, and is `parity_subdivide`
(Lemma 2.1) applied before any of this. Nothing below re-proves it. A consumer whose crosscut
lands in the interiors of edges rewrites with `parity_subdivide` first and then applies
`parity_split` to the subdivided list, whose hypotheses are about lists and not about polygons;
what such a consumer must supply for itself is the decomposition of the *subdivided* list into
two arcs, which `arcPieces` does not provide — `arcPieces` splits `C.pieces` at vertices.

## Blueprint

* `SameEdges`, `IsChainFrom`, `pathPieces`, `ClosedPolygon.arcPieces` — the definition of the
  split. "After the subdivision the edge set of `C` is the disjoint union of the edge sets of
  `A₁` and `A₂`, and the edge set of `Jᵢ` is that of `Aᵢ` together with that of `P`."
* `parity_split`, `ClosedPolygon.parity_splitting` — Lemma 2.7, equation (2.2)
  `π_C = π_{J₁} + π_{J₂}`.
* `ClosedPolygon.crosscut_inside_exactly_one`, `ClosedPolygon.crosscut_outside_agree` — the
  "Consequently" of Lemma 2.7, which is where Theorem 2.3 enters: a point of `Int(C)` off `P`
  lies inside exactly one of `J₁, J₂`, and a point of `Ext(C)` off `P` lies inside both or
  inside neither.
* `ClosedPolygon.parity_eq_one_iff` — the two halves of the last sentence of Theorem 2.3, read
  as a single criterion.
* `ClosedPolygon.carrier_eq_of_sameEdges`, `ClosedPolygon.notMem_carrier_of_sameEdges` — the
  bridge back to the sets: `Jᵢ` occupies `Aᵢ ∪ P`, so "off `C` and off `P`" is "off `Jᵢ`".

One lemma here strengthens one on `main`: `mark_swap'` drops the non-levelness hypothesis of
`Schoenflies.mark_swap`, because a level edge is crossed from nowhere and so contributes `0`
under either name. Its home is `Schoenflies/Parity.lean`.

/-! ## The identity

Everything above was the definition. The identity itself is one line of `ZMod 2` arithmetic:
the crosscut is counted once in each of `π_{J₁}` and `π_{J₂}`, so its contribution cancels. -/

/-- **Parity splitting** (Lemma 2.7), in edge-list form and with no geometry whatever. If the
edge list of `C` is the two arcs `A₁, A₂` and the edge list of `Jᵢ` is `Aᵢ` together with the
crosscut's list `K` — in each case up to reordering and up to reversing individual edges — then
`π_{J₁} + π_{J₂} = π_C` at *every* point of the plane.

The hypotheses carry all of the blueprint's picture; the proof is that `K` is counted twice. -/

/-- **Parity splitting** (Lemma 2.7) for a simple closed polygon cut at two of its vertices.
`K` is the edge list of the crosscut, `L₁` and `L₂` the edge lists of the two curves
`Jᵢ = Aᵢ ∪ P`; each is required only to carry the right edges, in any order and with either
name for each edge.

No hypothesis on `K` is needed: whatever it is, it is counted once on each side and cancels. -/

/-! ### What the identity says about the regions

Theorem 2.3 fixes the two values of `π` for each of the three curves — `1` on the bounded
region, `0` on the unbounded one — and the identity then reads off the blueprint's
"consequently". -/

Off the polygon, `π_C = 1` exactly on the bounded region. -/
