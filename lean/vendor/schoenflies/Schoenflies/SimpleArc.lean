# Simple polygonal arcs

`Schoenflies/PolyPath.lean` joins two points of a region by a polygonal *path* — a vertex list
whose carrier stays inside the region. A path may cross itself, so it is not an arc. This
module supplies the missing half of Lemma 1.1 and, with it, Lemma 1.2, by running the
blueprint's recipe: *subdivide at all intersections, delete duplicate subsegments, and take a
simple path in the resulting finite graph.*

The three steps are already available.

* Subdividing and deduplicating is `Schoenflies.overlayGraph`: a finite list of nondegenerate
  segments becomes a finite plane graph whose point set is exactly their union
  (`Schoenflies.overlayGraph_pointSet`).
* A simple path in that graph is `Graph.IsPath`, produced by `Graph.Reaches.exists_isPath`.
* Its realisation is an arc between its ends, by `Graph.IsDrawing.path_isArcBetween`.

## What actually has to be proved here

Two things, and neither is in the list above.

**The graph is connected when the union is.** The overlay is built from geometry, so nothing
so far says that two points joined *in the plane* are joined *along edges*. The argument is a
clopen one: for a vertex `a`, the points carried by the edges the walk relation can reach from
`a` form a compact set, the points carried by the other edges form another, the two are
disjoint — a common point would be a vertex incident with edges from both classes, by the
drawing condition — and together they are the whole union. Preconnectedness then forces the
second class to carry nothing.

**The realisation of a path is `poly` of a vertex list.** `Graph.IsDrawing.path_isArcBetween`
delivers `Graph.edgesCover`, a union of edge arcs with no order in it, while `IsPolygonal` and
every polygonal consumer downstream want a vertex list. `Schoenflies.exists_poly_eq_edgesCover`
recovers one by induction along the walk. Its statement returns the list, not the bare
existence of *some* polygonal set, so a consumer that needs the vertices — the redrawing
argument does — still has them.

Both endpoints have to be vertices of the overlay, which is arranged by putting them on the
list of cut points: `EndsAreCut` and `MeetsAreCut` only ask that certain points *occur* in
that list, so lengthening it is free.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.segsOf`, `Schoenflies.cover_segsOf` — a vertex list read as a list of
  nondegenerate segments, the input format the overlay wants.
* `Schoenflies.overlayGraph_reaches` — the overlay graph of a connected union is connected.
* `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_cover` — Lemma 1.2 (finite polygonal unions), for a union
  given as a finite list of nondegenerate segments.
* `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_poly`, `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_isPolygonal` —
  Lemma 1.2 for a set presented as a polygonal carrier.
* `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_biUnion`, `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_union` —
  Lemma 1.2 as the blueprint states it, for a finite union of polygonal sets.
* `Schoenflies.exists_simple_poly_of_isPreconnected`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_simple_arc_of_isPreconnected` — Lemma 1.1 (polygonal connectedness), in
  full: any two points of a region are joined in it by a *simple* polygonal arc.

## Two lemmas that belong elsewhere

`Schoenflies.cover_flatMap_list` generalises `Schoenflies.cover_flatMap` to an arbitrary index
list and belongs beside it in `Schoenflies/Subdivide.lean`; `Schoenflies.subset_of_finite_diff`
is a general fact about preconnected sets. Both are here only because their homes are on
`main`.

/-! ### One more shape of `poly`

`poly_cons_cons` peels a segment off a list of length at least two. The overlay's induction

/-! ### The segments of a vertex list

`poly` is a *chain*: consecutive vertices, with repetitions allowed. The overlay takes a list
of pieces and insists that each be nondegenerate, so a repetition has to be dropped rather
than passed on. Dropping one is harmless — a degenerate segment is a single point, and that
point is an end of the neighbouring segment — except when the whole chain degenerates to a
point, which is the second disjunct of `cover_segsOf`. -/

The proof is a clopen argument in the plane. Split the edges into those whose ends the walk

carried sets cover the union, and they are disjoint — a common point would, by the drawing
