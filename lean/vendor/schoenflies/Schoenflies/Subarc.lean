# Subarcs, open arcs, and the subarc basis

A subarc is the arc restricted to a subinterval of the parameter interval — but an arc is
carried by a map *on* `[0, 1]`, so the restriction has to be reparametrised back onto it.
That reparametrisation is `reparam a b : t ↦ a + t * (b - a)`: pure arithmetic, with no
inverse to construct and no choice to make. With it a subarc is a composition, and the two
things an arc must be — continuous and injective — are the two things a composition inherits.

Injectivity is required only on `uIcc a b`, the parameter interval actually traversed, not on
all of `[0, 1]`. That is what lets the two arcs of a Jordan curve be cut out of a loop, whose
parametrisation is injective on `[0, 1)` only.

The substance of the file is the last two sections. A parametrisation is an **open map onto
its arc**: the image of a relatively open piece of the parameter interval is relatively open
in the arc. This is where the continuity of the inverse earns its keep, and it is proved
without ever constructing that inverse — a continuous injection on a compact set is a closed
map onto its image, and a closed injective map is open onto its image, by complements.
Together with `basic_piece_inside_ball`, which puts such a piece inside any prescribed ball,
these images are a basis of the arc's subspace topology.

Relative openness is stated in the ambient form `∃ V, IsOpen V ∧ W = V ∩ A` rather than
through the subtype `↥A`, since every consumer here works with subsets of the plane.

## Blueprint

The blueprint uses subarcs throughout §1 without a numbered statement of their own; they are
the tool behind, among others, the model-curve parametrization (`lem:jordan-circle`), where
"the relatively open subarcs of `C`" are exactly the images produced by `image_isRelOpen`, and
the density arguments of `lem:accessible-dense`, which need `basic_piece_inside_ball`.

* `subarc`, `isArcBetween_subarc` — a piece of an arc is again an arc.
* `IsArc.exists_isArcBetween_subset` — the set-level reading: two points of an arc bound a
  subarc of it.
* `openArc` — the blueprint's `P°`, an arc without its two endpoints.
* `image_isRelOpen` — a parametrisation is an open map onto its arc; `openArc_isRelOpen` and
  `openArc_subarc_isRelOpen` are the "relatively open subarcs" of `lem:jordan-circle`.
* `basic_piece_inside_ball` — the subarc basis.

/-- The open arc — the blueprint's `P°`: an arc with its two endpoints removed.

Taken on the parameter side, as the image of the open unit interval, because that is the form
the subarc basis argument needs: an open subarc is the image of an open subinterval.
Injectivity then says it is also the arc minus the two endpoint *values*, which is how the
blueprint reads it (`openArc_eq_diff`). -/

parameter shares them. -/

/-! ### The interior of an arc, set-level

`openArc` is stated for a parametrisation. Three separate modules needed the same facts stated
for the *set* — `IsArcBetween A p q` gives `A ∖ {p, q}` connected, nonempty, and having both
endpoints in its closure — and each proved them again from scratch, one of them twice under two
names. Two of those copies were literally the same statement in modules that do not import each
other, so the build never noticed: alpha-equivalent `Prop`s are defeq under proof irrelevance,
and Lean's import checker accepts them. They live here now. -/

/-- **The parametrisation is an open map onto its arc.** The image of a relatively open piece
of the parameter interval is relatively open in the arc.

No inverse is constructed. The complement piece `I \ U` is compact, so its image is compact,
so it is closed; and by injectivity the image of `U ∩ I` is exactly the arc minus that closed
set. Stated for a relatively open *piece* `U ∩ I` rather than for a subarc, because at an
endpoint the basic neighbourhood is half-open — `openArc` of a subarc is the interior case,
and this covers both. -/
