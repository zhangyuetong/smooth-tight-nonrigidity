# The crossing count of a polygon, and its parity

This is the arithmetic half of the polygonal Jordan curve theorem. A closed polygon is a
list of edges; a point off it gets a number, the count of edges the ray leaving the point
meets; and the whole separation statement follows from the fact that this number changes by
one exactly when the ray's foot sweeps across an edge.

## The frame

The blueprint rotates the coordinate system so that no edge is horizontal. Rotating a curve
is a change of the curve, which would have to be transported back at the end, so instead the
*ray direction* is carried as a parameter. A direction `u` (a unit vector,
`Plane.IsDirection`) fixes an orthonormal frame through

* `fwd u z` — how far along `u` the point `z` lies,
* `hgt u z` — how far across `u` it lies, positive on the counterclockwise side.

"Horizontal" becomes "level for `u`", i.e. `hgt u a = hgt u b`, and
`exists_direction_hgt_ne` — a one-line consequence of `Plane.exists_isDirection_det_ne_zero`
— supplies a `u` for which no edge of a finite list is level. Nothing below needs the
direction to be produced that way: `hgt u P.1 ≠ hgt u P.2` for every piece is carried as a
hypothesis, so no curve is ever moved and nothing has to be transported back.

## The count

An edge is a `Piece`, i.e. its pair of ends, and a polygon is a `List Piece` — the same
representation the overlay uses, so a subdivision produced by `Schoenflies.subdivide` can be
fed straight in. `Crosses u P q` says that the level line through `q` meets `P` strictly
beyond `q`, with the blueprint's half-open convention at the lower end, which is what makes
the count well defined with no genericity assumption. `crossings` counts and `parity`
reduces mod `2`.

Closedness of the polygon enters through `IsClosedChain`: the boundary of the edge list
vanishes mod `2`, stated by duality as "every `ZMod 2`-valued function of the ends sums to
zero over the list". `edgesOf` builds a closed chain from a cyclic vertex list, and
`IsClosedChain` survives `subdivide`.

## Blueprint

* `crossings`, `parity` — the count `π_C` of the section "The polygonal Jordan and crosscut
  theorems".
* `exists_direction_hgt_ne` — the setup of that section: a ray direction level for no edge.
* `crossings_subdivide`, `parity_subdivide` — Lemma 2.1 (subdivision invariance). Proved for
  the *count*, not only its parity, and for the whole `subdivide` operation of
  `Schoenflies.Subdivide`, not only for a single cut.
* `parity_eq_of_mem_ball`, `parity_eq_of_isPreconnected`,
  `parity_eq_of_mem_connectedComponentIn` — the first half of Lemma 2.2 (crossing parity):
  `π_C` is locally constant off the polygon, hence constant on each component of the
  complement.
* `parity_flip` — the second half of Lemma 4.4: the two local sides of an edge have opposite
  parity.
* `parity_eq_zero_of_lt` — `π_C = 0` beyond the polygon in the ray direction; the value on
  the unbounded region.
* `IsClosedChain`, `edgesOf`, `isClosedChain_subdivide` — the closedness hypothesis, its
  supply from a cyclic vertex list, and its survival of subdivision.
