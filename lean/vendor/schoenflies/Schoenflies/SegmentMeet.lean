# How two segments meet

Two segments meet in nothing, or in a segment. The blueprint says "the empty set, one
point, or one closed interval" (Lemma 3.7, polygonal overlay); a point *is* a segment with
equal endpoints, so the statement folds to a dichotomy, and that is the form the overlay
wants — it subdivides at the endpoints of whatever the meet turns out to be, and a
degenerate meet contributes one subdivision point.

No case analysis on whether the segments are parallel, and no determinant. The meet is
compact and convex, so its preimage under the parametrization `lineMap a b` is a compact
convex subset of `ℝ`, hence a closed interval; pushing that interval forward is a segment.

## Blueprint

* `segment_inter_segment` — the meet dichotomy used by Lemma 3.7.
