# The local source grid, and the missing hypothesis of the anchored square mesh

Two things, and the second is the more important.

## 1. `prop:anchored-square-mesh` clause 5 — which hypothesis repairs it

`docs/ROADMAP.md` records clause 5, *the skeleton of `T` is 2-connected*, as **false** for
`Schoenflies.squareMesh` when the fresh-point set is too small, and names
`Schoenflies.FreshDense` as "the shape the missing hypothesis should take". The first section
of this module checks that, and the answer is **no: `FreshDense` alone does not repair
clause 5.**

* `Schoenflies.freshDense_of_four_sqrt_two_le` — for `4√2 ≤ δ`, `FreshDense fresh δ` holds for
  **every** list `fresh`, the empty one included, because `S` itself has diameter `2√2`. So
  `FreshDense fresh δ` is vacuous at large `δ` and excludes nothing.
* `Schoenflies.freshDense_not_isTwoConnected` — the counterexample made formal: at
  `δ = 4√2` the hypotheses `0 < δ` and `FreshDense [] δ` both hold and
  `squareMesh δ [] anchors` is still not 2-connected.

What does repair it is `FreshDense` **together with a bound on `δ`**:

* `Schoenflies.exists_two_distinct_fresh_of_freshDense` — `FreshDense fresh δ` and `δ < 4`
  force two distinct fresh points. (`4` is not the sharp constant — `4√2` is — but it is the
  one a side of `S`, whose two ends are `2` apart, gives with no work. The blueprint's own
  `δ = ε_n = 2^{-n}` is far below either.)

and two distinct fresh points is exactly the right amount, because *fewer* is always fatal:

* `Schoenflies.not_isTwoConnected_meshGraph_of_fresh_subsingleton` — a mesh whose fresh points
  are not two distinct points is **never** 2-connected. This closes the case
  `SquareMeshFixed.lean` left open in prose: with exactly one fresh point `z` the mesh is
  connected, but `z` is a cut vertex, because the spoke at `z` is the only edge of the mesh
  that changes the sup norm and every other edge preserves it.

So the correct statement of clause 5 carries the hypothesis `∃ z ∈ fresh, ∃ w ∈ fresh, z ≠ w`,
which `FreshDense fresh δ ∧ δ < 4` supplies, and which is necessary as well as sufficient in
the degenerate range.

## 2. `prop:local-grid-attachment` — the grid

The blueprint's proof begins: *"Choose sufficiently fine finite horizontal and vertical
coordinate sets in `W`, with at least two intervals in each direction. Begin with the outer
rectangle of the resulting grid `K` … By `lem:subdivision-ear-preserve`, `K` is 2-connected."*

`Schoenflies.localGrid` is that `K`, as a `def`: the uniform `k × k` grid on the closed square
`W` of centre `p` and radius `s`. `Schoenflies/SquareMeshConnected.lean` and
`Schoenflies/SquareMeshFixed.lean` supply everything combinatorial about a grid, so what is
added here is the *quantitative* clause the proposition needs — every closed grid rectangle has
diameter `< ε` — together with the instantiation of the general grid lemmas at these
coordinates.

The rest of `prop:local-grid-attachment` — the overlay of `K` with the polygonal nonboundary
skeleton of `Γ`, the three cases, and the component-joining loop — is **not** here; see the
report.

## Blueprint

* `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, clause 5 — `freshDense_of_four_sqrt_two_le`,
  `freshDense_not_isTwoConnected`, `exists_two_distinct_fresh_of_freshDense`,
  `not_isTwoConnected_meshGraph_of_fresh_subsingleton`,
  `not_isTwoConnected_squareMesh_of_fresh_subsingleton`.
* `prop:local-grid-attachment`, the grid `K` — `localGrid`, `localGrid_isTwoConnected`,
  `localGrid_subdivide_isTwoConnected`, `localGrid_isDrawing`, `localGrid_outer_cycle`.
* `prop:local-grid-attachment`, clause 3 — `dist_le_of_mem_localGridCell` (the closed grid
  rectangle), `dist_lt_of_avoiding_localGrid` (a connected subset of `W` missing the grid),
  `localGridCount`, `localGridCount_spec`, `localGrid_fine`.
* `lem:union-two-connected` — used through `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union` and
  `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear`; `Graph.IsTwoConnected.of_le_of_vertexSet_subset` is the
  "spanning 2-connected subgraph" form the assembly needs.

/-! ### The diameter of `S`

`S = modelCurve` is the frame of `[-1,1]²`, so any two of its points are at sup distance at
most `2` and hence at Euclidean distance at most `2√2`. That single bound is what makes
`FreshDense fresh δ` vacuous once `δ ≥ 4√2`. -/

A side of `S` is a connected subset of `S` whose two ends are `2` apart. If no two fresh points
are distinct then some side avoids all of them — a single point cannot lie on both the top and
the bottom side — and `FreshDense fresh δ` applied to that side forces `4 ≤ δ`. -/

/-! ### Fewer than two distinct fresh points is always fatal

`SquareMeshFixed.not_isTwoConnected_squareMesh_of_fresh_nil` settles `fresh = []` by showing
the mesh disconnected. The remaining degenerate case — exactly one fresh point — is settled
here, and by the same invariant.

Every edge of the mesh is a subsegment of a source segment, and a source segment is either a
side of a ring, on which the sup norm is constant, or the spoke at a fresh point `z`, along
which the only point of sup norm `1` is `z` itself. So once `z` is deleted, **no** edge of the
mesh joins a vertex of sup norm `1` to a vertex of smaller sup norm: `z` is a cut vertex. -/

/-- Along an edge of the mesh whose ends are both different from the one fresh point `z`, the
predicate "sup norm is `1`" is constant. -/
