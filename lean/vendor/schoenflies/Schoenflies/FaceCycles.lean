# Face cycles: the base cycle, and the faces of a plane graph that grows by ears

`lem:face-cycles` — *every face of a finite 2-connected polygonal plane graph has a cycle as
its boundary and is one of the two complementary regions of that cycle* — is proved by growing
the graph from a cycle by ears (`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition`) and applying
`thm:polygonal-crosscut` at each step. This file supplies everything in that proof that is not
the crosscut application itself. **The lemma is not proved here**; see "What is missing" below,
which says exactly what is in the way.

## The base cycle

The blueprint's first paragraph, in full. *"First choose a cycle of length at least three.
Such a cycle exists: under our convention the graph has at least three vertices, and every
vertex has at least two distinct neighbors. Indeed, if a vertex `v` had only one distinct
neighbor `w`, then deleting `w` would isolate `v` from some third vertex, contrary to
2-connectivity. Now take a maximal simple path. An endpoint has a neighbor on the path other
than its predecessor, and the resulting closed subpath is a cycle of length at least three."*

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_adj_ne` is the two-neighbours sentence; "take a maximal simple
path" is `Graph.exists_longest_path`, already in `Schoenflies/Graph/Tree.lean` and not rebuilt
here; and `Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_long_cycle` is the conclusion, packaged as
`Graph.IsLongCycle`, a cycle together with a *named* third vertex. Naming the third vertex
rather than counting is what both consumers want: the counting clause of
`Graph.IsTwoConnected`, and — later — the non-degeneracy of the polygon the cycle draws.

`Graph.cycleGraph` is that cycle as a subgraph, and `Graph.IsLongCycle.isTwoConnected` is
*"the cycle `C` is 2-connected, so Lemma `lem:relative-ear` builds the graph from `C`"*. This
is the one place "length at least three" is used: a two-vertex cycle is a `Graph.banana`, and
`Graph.not_isTwoConnected_banana` says it is not 2-connected.

## One step of the induction

Adding an ear removes the ear's own point set from the exterior and changes nothing else:
`Graph.pointSet_union`, `Graph.exterior_union` and `Graph.face_union_eq_of_disjoint` are
*"all other faces are unchanged"*.

`Graph.IsDrawing.exists_face_of_ear` is *"its interior is connected and disjoint from the
current graph, so it lies in one current face `F`"*: the ear's realisation without its two ends
is the interior of an arc, hence connected
(`Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.isConnected_diff`), and it misses the drawing of the current
subgraph altogether (`Graph.IsDrawing.edgesCover_inter_pointSet`).
`Graph.IsDrawing.ends_mem_frontier_face` is the next sentence, *"the ear's two endpoints are
limits of its interior, which lies in `F`, so they lie on `∂F`"* — which is what makes the ear
a crosscut of that face.

`Graph.IsDrawing.mono` — a subgraph of a plane graph is a plane graph, with the same drawing —
is what lets the induction talk about the faces of the current subgraph at all.

## An interface repair

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition` hands its step the ear's path but **not** the clause
`∀ g ∈ D, g ∉ E(B)`, which `Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_ear_exists` proves and which
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_grows_by_ear` drops on the way. A geometric consumer needs it:
without it the ear may be drawn right on top of the current subgraph, and
`Graph.IsDrawing.edgesCover_inter_pointSet` is false. `Graph.ear_edges_notMem_or_union_eq`
recovers it in the only form available from the outside — either every edge of the ear is new,
or the ear is a single edge the subgraph already had and the enlarged graph *is* the old graph,
so the step has nothing to prove. The better fix is for the integrator to add the clause to
`relative_grows_by_ear` and to `ear_decomposition`; that would make this lemma unnecessary.

## What is missing

The crosscut application, and therefore `lem:face-cycles` itself. `thm:polygonal-crosscut` is
available as `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut` and `Schoenflies.polygonal_crosscut`, whose
hypotheses are stated for `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon`s: an explicit cyclic vertex list with
`vertex_inj`, `edges_meet` and `corner` (no two consecutive edges collinear). The realisation
of a graph cycle arrives here as a **set** — `Graph.edgesCover drawing (e :: D)` — which
`Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isJordanCurve` knows to be a Jordan curve and `Graph.polygonal_redrawing`
knows to be polygonal. Turning such a set into a `ClosedPolygon` (enumerate its vertices
cyclically, delete the redundant collinear ones, and derive `vertex_inj` and `edges_meet` from
simplicity) is a construction `main` does not have, and the same construction is needed again
for the two curves `Aᵢ ∪ P` that the crosscut produces. Nothing below pretends to it, and no
statement below is weaker than its blueprint counterpart.

## Namespace

Root `Graph`, as fixed by `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean`. The two arc lemmas are stated in
`Schoenflies`, where the rest of the arc theory lives.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_adj_ne` — "every vertex has at least two distinct neighbors".
* `Graph.IsLongCycle`, `Graph.IsTwoConnected.exists_long_cycle` — "the resulting closed subpath
  is a cycle of length at least three".
* `Graph.cycleGraph`, `Graph.IsLongCycle.isTwoConnected` — "the cycle `C` is 2-connected, so
  Lemma `lem:relative-ear` builds the graph from `C`".
* `Graph.ear_edges_notMem_or_union_eq` — the ear's edges are new, or the ear is not an ear.
* `Graph.pointSet_union`, `Graph.exterior_union`, `Graph.face_union_subset`,
  `Graph.face_union_eq_of_disjoint` — "all other faces are unchanged".
* `Graph.IsDrawing.mono` — the current subgraph is itself a plane graph.
* `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.isConnected_diff`,
  `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.left_mem_closure_diff`, `…right_mem_closure_diff`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.edgesCover_inter_pointSet`, `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_face_of_ear`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.ends_mem_frontier_face` — "its interior is connected and disjoint from the
  current graph, so it lies in one current face `F` … the ear's two endpoints are limits of its
  interior, which lies in `F`, so they lie on `∂F`; the ear is therefore a crosscut of that
  side".

`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition` hands its step the ear's path but **not** the clause
`∀ g ∈ D, g ∉ E(B)` that `Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_ear_exists` proves and that
`Graph.IsTwoConnected.relative_grows_by_ear` drops. A *geometric* consumer needs it: the ear's
drawing has to miss the drawing of the current subgraph, and an edge shared with `B` would sit
right on it.

It is recoverable, and this section recovers it. An edge of the ear that `B` already has must
join the ear's two ends; the ear is then that single edge, and the enlarged graph is the old
one, so the step has nothing to prove. The integrator may prefer to add the clause to
`relative_grows_by_ear` and to `ear_decomposition` instead — that is the better fix, and it
makes this section unnecessary. -/

/-! ## The faces of a graph that grows

Adding an ear removes the ear's own point set from the exterior and changes nothing else. That
is the whole of "all other faces are unchanged", and the half of "its interior is connected and
disjoint from the current graph, so it lies in one current face `F`" that is pure topology. -/

ends.** Two cases, and both come down to the ear's freshness clause: a point of the ear on a
*vertex* of `B` is an end of the edge of the ear it lies on
(`Graph.IsDrawing.vertex_mem_edgeArc`), and a point of the ear on an *edge* of `B` is a vertex
incident with both (`Graph.IsDrawing.edge_inter`) — the two edges being distinct because no
edge of the ear belongs to `B`. Either way the point is a vertex of `B` that the ear visits,
which the freshness clause makes one of the ear's two ends. -/

/-! ### A subgraph of a plane graph is a plane graph

The induction speaks of the faces of the *current* subgraph, so every step needs the current
subgraph to be a plane graph in its own right. Nothing has to be redrawn: the same drawing
serves. General, and not in `Schoenflies/Graph/Drawing.lean`; the integrator may want to hoist
it. -/
