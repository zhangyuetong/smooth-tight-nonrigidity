# Topology of the plane: the gaps Mathlib leaves

Appendix C of the blueprint lists the topology imported without proof. Almost all of it is in
Mathlib: compactness and Heine–Borel, the compact-to-Hausdorff homeomorphism criterion,
connectedness and its stability under images, unions through a common point, adjoining closure
points (`IsPreconnected.subset_closure`), a connected set inside a disjoint union of two opens
(`IsPreconnected.subset_left_of_subset_union`), `Metric.diam_closure`, thickenings, and the
two-piece pasting lemma (`continuousOn_union_iff_of_isClosed`).

This module collects the few that are not stated in the form the development uses.

## Blueprint

* `isOpen_connectedComponentIn` — Appendix C item 4: components of open subsets of the plane
  are open. The plane is locally connected, so this is Mathlib's, restated at `Plane` so that
  the instance is found once here rather than at every call site.
* `frontier_connectedComponentIn_compl_subset` — Appendix C item 5: the boundary of a component
  of the complement of a closed set lies in that closed set. This is the form Part I uses to
  recognize that a region's frontier sits on the curve.
* `continuousOn_union_of_isClosed` — Appendix C item 6, the pasting lemma, in the two-piece
  form the development pastes with.
