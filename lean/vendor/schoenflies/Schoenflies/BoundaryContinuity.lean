# `lem:skeleton-crosscuts`: a crosscut inside one stage of the skeleton

Two anchors lying in a common finite stage are joined by a polygonal crosscut of the Jordan
domain that lies *in that stage's skeleton* (`jordan_schoenflies.tex` 2857-2872). This file
proves the first clause, for the source side.

Everything here concerns **one finite plane graph**: a stage is a
finite plane graph whose point set carries the Jordan curve `C` as its outer boundary
(`Graph.IsStageOn`), and nothing below mentions the sequence of stages that produces it.

The blueprint's proof splits on whether some *nonboundary* edge — one whose arc is not
contained in `C` — has both of its ends on `C`. If one does, its open interior is a whole
component of the open nonboundary part, so it is the only nonboundary edge and is itself the
crosscut. Otherwise every nonboundary edge meeting `C` has its other end inside, and the
interior subgraph `interiorPart` is connected because the half-open attached edges partition
the open nonboundary part into relatively clopen pieces.

## What is here, and what is not

This module was written in one sitting that ended early, and it stops after the source-side
crosscut. The rest of the section — the target crosscut of clause 2,
`lem:crosscut-side-correspondence`, `prop:boundary-continuity`, and the assembly of
`thm:square-extension` — is in `Schoenflies/BoundaryContinuity2.lean`, which imports this one.
An earlier version of this docstring listed those as if they were here; they never were.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsStageOn` — a finite plane graph carrying `C` as its outer boundary.
* `Graph.Nonboundary`, `Graph.interiorPart`, `Graph.attachEdges`,
  `Graph.isPreconnected_interiorPart` — the interior subgraph and its connectedness, which is
  the substance of the second case.
* `Graph.IsStageOn.exists_crosscut` — **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts`, clause 1**: the source-side
  polygonal crosscut between two prescribed points of `C` that the stage joins. Clause 2, the
  target crosscut, is in `Schoenflies/BoundaryContinuity2.lean`.

/-! ## `lem:skeleton-crosscuts`

A stage of the skeleton is a finite plane graph whose point set carries the Jordan curve `C` as
its outer boundary. The blueprint's proof splits on whether some *nonboundary* edge — an edge
whose arc is not contained in `C` — has both of its ends on `C`.

Everything in this section speaks about one finite plane graph and never
about the stages that produce it.

def Nonboundary (drawing : β → ℝ → Plane) (C : Set Plane) (e : β) : Prop :=
  ¬ edgeArc drawing e ⊆ C

/-- **One finite stage of the skeleton**, as `lem:skeleton-crosscuts` uses it.

`C` is the outer boundary and `D` the region it bounds. The two substantive clauses are
`edge_split` — every edge either runs inside `C` or has all of its non-endpoint points in `D` —
and `isConnected_diff`, the admissibility hypothesis that the *open nonboundary part*
`|Γ| ∖ C` is connected.

`D` is an arbitrary set disjoint from `C`, not `Schoenflies.inside C`: the proof uses nothing
about it, and the consumer instantiates it with the Jordan domain. -/

  /-- the graph is drawn in the plane -/

  /-- every **nonboundary** edge is drawn as a polygonal arc.

  Only the nonboundary edges: `def:admissible-graph` says "its edges *not contained in `C`* are
  polygonal arcs", and for a source stage that restriction is not a convenience but a necessity.
  The outer edges of a source stage are subarcs of the wild Jordan curve `C`, which is in general
  nowhere polygonal, so a field asking `IsPolygonal` of every edge would make `IsStageOn`
  unsatisfiable for exactly the graphs `lem:skeleton-crosscuts` is about. It was stated that way
  and is repaired here; both proofs below already applied it only to nonboundary edges. -/

/-! ### Case 1: a nonboundary edge with both ends on the outer boundary

*Its open interior `e°` is a connected component of `X = |Γ| ∖ C`, because an edge interior
meets the rest of the graph only at its endpoints, and those endpoints have been removed. Hence
`X = e°`, and there is then only one nonboundary edge.* -/

/-- **Case 1, first half.** If a nonboundary edge `e` has both ends on `C`, the whole open
nonboundary part lies on `e`.

The proof is `lem:clopen-component` in the closed-set form: `edgeArc e` and the rest of the
drawing are two closed sets covering the point set whose common part misses `X`. -/

/-! ### `lem:skeleton-crosscuts` -/

/-- **`lem:skeleton-crosscuts`.** Two distinct points of the outer boundary, each incident with
a nonboundary edge of the stage, are joined by a polygonal crosscut lying in the stage's
skeleton: a simple polygonal arc between them meeting `C` only at its two ends.

In case 1 the crosscut is a single edge; in case 2 it is extracted from
`Y = e_a ∪ |Λ| ∪ e_b` by `lem:finite-polygonal-union`
(`Schoenflies.exists_crosscut_arc_of_biUnion_finite`). -/
