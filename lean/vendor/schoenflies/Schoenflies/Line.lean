# Lines in the plane

A line is the range of the parametrization `t ↦ lineMap a b t = a + t • (b - a)` through two
points. Taking the *range of the parametrization* as the definition, rather than
`affineSpan ℝ {a, b}`, is deliberate: every proof below transports a subset of the line to a
subset of `ℝ` and back, so the parametrization has to be available at once. `line_eq_affineSpan`
records that the two descriptions agree, for a consumer that meets a line as a span.

The transport is a homeomorphism, but it is never bundled as one. Instead the inverse
`lineCoord a b x = ⟪x - a, b - a⟫ / ‖b - a‖²` is defined on the whole plane, is continuous
there, and is a two-sided inverse of the parametrization on the line (`lineCoord_lineMap`,
`lineMap_lineCoord`). Pushing a subset of the line forward along `lineCoord` and pulling it back
along `lineMap` is all that the arguments below need, and no subspace topology ever appears.

The two facts Appendix C item 1 asks for:

* a nondegenerate compact connected subset of a line is a closed segment;
* a component of the intersection of a line with a bounded open set is a bounded open segment,
  whose closure is a closed segment with endpoints in the *frontier* of the open set.

The second is what manufactures crosscuts — the blueprint uses it twice in the proof of the
`K₃,₃`-subdivision corollary ("the closure `E` of the component of `ℓ ∩ F` containing `y` is a
crosscut of `F`") — so its endpoint conclusion is stated as membership in `frontier U`, and not
merely in `closure U`.

## Blueprint

* `Plane.line`, `Plane.lineCoord` — Appendix C, item 1 (lines and their parametrization).
* `Plane.exists_segment_eq_of_isCompact_isConnected`,
  `Plane.exists_segment_eq_of_not_subsingleton` — Appendix C, item 1: a nondegenerate compact
  connected subset of a line is a closed segment.
* `Plane.exists_openSegment_eq_connectedComponentIn` — Appendix C, item 1: a component of the
  intersection of a line with a bounded open set is an open segment whose closure is a closed
  segment with endpoints in the frontier of the open set.
* `Plane.eqOn_line_of_fixed` — Appendix C, item 1: an affine map fixing two points of a line
  fixes that line pointwise.
* `Plane.affineMap_ext_of_affineIndependent` — Appendix C, item 1: an affine map of the plane is
  determined by its values at three affinely independent points.

`exists_Ioo_eq_connectedComponentIn` is the one-dimensional core: a component of a bounded open
subset of `ℝ` is an open interval whose endpoints are outside the set.

A component of a bounded open subset of `ℝ` is a bounded open interval whose endpoints are
missing from the set. Everything the plane statement says about a component of `ℓ ∩ U` is this
fact transported along the parametrization. -/
