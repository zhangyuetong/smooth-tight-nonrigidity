# The polygon bridge

Two independent representations of a closed polygon had grown up side by side and never met.
`Schoenflies/Strip.lean` carries `ClosedPolygon m`, a cyclic vertex list indexed by
`ZMod (m + 3)`, and everything the collar of Lemma 1.8 says is said about it.
`Schoenflies/Parity.lean` carries `List Piece` together with `IsClosedChain`, and everything
the crossing count of Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 says is said about *that*. Neither knew about
the other, and — worse — nothing anywhere produced a `ClosedPolygon`, so every theorem about
one was formally a theorem about a structure that might have been empty.

This module closes the three gaps.

## Non-vacuity

`Schoenflies.triangle` builds a `ClosedPolygon 0` out of any three points with nonzero
orientation determinant, and `Schoenflies.unitTriangle` is the concrete instance with vertices
`(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`. The only real work is `edges_meet`: two edges of a triangle share
exactly one endpoint, and `Schoenflies.segment_inter_shared` says two segments meeting at an
endpoint whose far ends are off the shared line meet nowhere else. That lemma is proved by
taking the orientation form against the first segment's direction, which kills the first
segment's own parameter and forces the second's to vanish.

## The representation bridge

`ClosedPolygon.pieces` lists the `m + 3` edges as pairs of endpoints, in cyclic order.
It is a closed chain (`ClosedPolygon.isClosedChain_pieces`), every piece is nondegenerate
(`ClosedPolygon.pieces_nondeg`), and — the point of the exercise —
`ClosedPolygon.cover_pieces` says it occupies exactly the polygon's carrier. Closedness is a
telescoping sum: `Schoenflies.sum_range_boundary` evaluates the mod-`2` boundary of the chain
`0 → 1 → ⋯ → n` as the sum of its two ends, and the two ends of `0 → ⋯ → m + 3` are the same
vertex because `m + 3` is `0` in `ZMod (m + 3)`.

## The curve bridge

`ClosedPolygon.isJordanCurve_carrier` and `ClosedPolygon.isPolygonal_carrier` say the carrier
is a simple closed polygonal curve in the blueprint's sense, which is what the polygonal Jordan
curve theorem (Theorem 2.3) takes as its hypothesis. The loop is built by concatenating edge
parametrizations around the cycle: `ClosedPolygon.chain k` is the union of the edges leaving
vertices `0, …, k`, and `ClosedPolygon.isArcBetween_chain` grows it one edge at a time by
`IsArcBetween.concatenate`. The hypothesis that concatenation needs — the new edge meets what
came before only at the vertex they share — is exactly `edges_meet` twice over: once to place
the meeting point among the new edge's own two endpoints, and once more to rule out the far
one, which would otherwise let the polygon close early. The last edge closes the loop through
`IsJordanCurve.of_two_arcs`, and there the far endpoint is *not* ruled out: it is the second
shared point that makes the two arcs a curve rather than an arc.

## Both halves at once

The last section is what the bridge is for: the two statements of Lemma 2.2 — parity is
constant on a component of the complement, and it flips across an edge — restated for the
*carrier* of a `ClosedPolygon` rather than for the cover of an anonymous list. The flip needs
the edge list split around the edge being crossed, which is `List.append_of_mem` together with
`ClosedPolygon.pieces_nodup`; that the two remaining fragments miss the crossing point is
`edges_meet` a third time.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.triangle`, `Schoenflies.unitTriangle` — witnesses that §1's "simple closed
  polygonal curve" is not vacuous.
* `ClosedPolygon.pieces`, `ClosedPolygon.cover_pieces`, `ClosedPolygon.isClosedChain_pieces` —
  the edge list the crossing count of §2 is defined on, and that it carries the polygon.
* `ClosedPolygon.isJordanCurve_carrier`, `ClosedPolygon.isPolygonal_carrier` — §1, "a simple
  closed polygonal curve"; jointly the hypothesis of Theorem 2.3.
* `ClosedPolygon.parity_eq_of_mem_connectedComponentIn_carrier`,
  `ClosedPolygon.parity_flip_carrier` — the two halves of Lemma 2.2, read off a
  `ClosedPolygon`. These are the statements Theorem 2.3 consumes.

One general lemma is stated here that does not belong here: `Schoenflies.exists_of_mem_cover`,
the destructor matching `Schoenflies.mem_cover`, whose home is `Schoenflies/Parity.lean`.

/-! ## Two segments that share an endpoint

The one piece of plane geometry this module needs. `Schoenflies/SegmentMeet.lean` describes
the intersection of two arbitrary segments; here the two are known to share an endpoint, and
the conclusion is sharper and the proof shorter. -/

/-- Two segments sharing the endpoint `b`, whose far ends are off the line through the other,
meet only at `b`. Taking the orientation form against `b - a` annihilates the first segment's
own parameter, so the second segment's parameter must vanish. -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity: a triangle is a closed polygon

Nothing in the strip development ever built a `ClosedPolygon`, so `polygonal_collar` and every
theorem beside it was formally a theorem about a structure with no known inhabitant. A triangle
is the smallest witness, and no coordinates are needed: any three points with nonzero
orientation determinant will do. -/

/-! ### The flip across an edge

The second half of Lemma 2.2 is stated for the edge list split around the edge being crossed,
`L₁ ++ (a, b) :: L₂`. Splitting is `List.append_of_mem`; what has to be checked is that the two
remaining fragments miss the point being crossed, and that is `edges_meet` again — another edge
can reach an interior point of this one only at one of this one's two ends, which an interior
point is not. -/

meeting point at an end of this one, and an interior point is neither end. -/
