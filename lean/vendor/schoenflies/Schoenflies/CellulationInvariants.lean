# The two cellulation invariants that need the crosscut theorem

`Schoenflies/GeneratedStructure.lean` proves seven of the nine assertions of
`lem:cellulation-invariants` — (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) and (ix), and (i) for the
edge-subdivision constructor. The two it leaves open are exactly the two whose induction step is
`thm:general-crosscut`:

* **(vii)** in each realization every 2-cell boundary is a Jordan curve and the open 2-cell is
  its bounded complementary region;
* **(i)** at the *split* constructor.

Both are proved here. `Schoenflies.crosscut_theorem` does not depend on `main`, and neither does
anything in this module.

## Realizations stay outside the inductive

`Schoenflies.GeneratedStructure` is purely abstract — it carries no realizations at all — while
(i), (vii), (viii) and (ix) are statements about realizations. `RefinementStars.lean` bridges
that by stating its lemmas for an arbitrary `Realization` satisfying `IsCellDecomposition`, and
this module follows the same pattern: the induction over the constructors is replaced by two
*step* theorems, one per constructor, each relating a realization of the refined structure to a
realization of the old one. A consumer building a sequence of stages carries the realizations
itself and applies the step theorem at each stage.

The alternative — realizations as fields of the inductive — was rejected for the reason
`RefinementStars.lean` gives: the limit argument "forgets how the decompositions were
constructed", so the abstract closure and the geometric invariants must be separable. It would
also force every consumer to commit to *two* realizations at the moment it builds an abstract
stage, which `thm:finite-transfer` does not do.

## What assertion (vii) is stated against, and why not the boundary walk

The blueprint phrases (vii) as "every 2-cell boundary **walk** is realized by a Jordan curve".
`CellStructure.boundary : γ → List γ` is a raw datum on which `CellStructure` imposes *no*
axiom whatever: nothing says `S.boundary F` is a closed walk, nothing ties it to `S.sub`, and
nothing ties it to `F`. A version of (vii) phrased against it therefore needs the separate
boundary-cycle invariant that the finite-transfer construction maintains.

So (vii) is stated against the cells: `Realization.faceBoundary F` is the union of the open
cells strictly below `F`, and `IsCellDecomposition.faceBoundary_eq_frontier` identifies it with
`frontier (R.cell F)` as soon as the open 2-cell is open. Assertion (vii) then reads: that
frontier is a Jordan curve, and `R.cell F` is its `inside`. This is the content every consumer
uses — (viii) needs only openness of the 2-cell, `lem:star-face-mesh` needs only the closed
2-cells, and the limit map needs `R.cell F = inside (…)`. Nothing downstream reads the cyclic
order of the walk.

## The orientation-aware update of `subdivideEdge`

`CellStructure.subdivideEdge` cannot compute a corrected boundary from an edge list alone: a
walk traverses `d.edge` in a definite direction, while the same interior edge occurs in the two
incident face boundaries with opposite orientations. `SubdivData` therefore carries the new
boundary lists as data, together with `SubstWalk` proofs that each list replaces the old closed
walk in the correct direction. `SubstWalk.isWalk` proves that every new boundary is again a
closed walk.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.cellUnion`, `Schoenflies.CellStructure.subcells`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.faceBoundary` — the realized point set of a set of
  abstract cells, and the boundary of a 2-cell read off the abstract data.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsFaceJordan` — **assertion (vii)** of
  `lem:cellulation-invariants`, for one realization.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsCellDecomposition.face_eq_of_isFaceJordan`,
  `…sub_face_eq` — **assertion (viii)** with its openness hypothesis discharged by (vii).
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.IsRefinement.isFaceJordan` — (vii) is preserved by an
  edge subdivision.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.IsRefinement` — the split analogue of
  `SubdivData.IsRefinement`, and `…IsRefinement.isCellDecomposition` — **assertion (i) at the
  split constructor**.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.IsRefinement.refines` — the one-liner
  `RefinementStars.lean` asked for, next to `SubdivData.IsRefinement.refines`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.IsCrosscutSplit`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.IsCrosscutSplit.isRefinement`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SplitData.IsCrosscutSplit.isFaceJordan` — the geometric input of one
  split (the ear drawn as a crosscut of the old Jordan face), and the two invariants
  *constructed* from it by `Schoenflies.crosscut_theorem`. This is the blueprint's
  "Theorem `thm:general-crosscut` decomposes the old open 2-cell into the disjoint union of the
  two new open 2-cells and the open cells of the ear, and gives
  `closure Rᵢ = Rᵢ ∪ P ∪ Bᵢ`".
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.SubstWalk`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.SubstWalk.isWalk`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.boundary_isWalk` — the orientation-aware boundary-walk
  update. Not a blueprint statement: the blueprint's operation 1 does not spell the update
  out, and this is what it has to be.

"In each of the two realizations, every 2-cell boundary walk is realized by a Jordan curve, and
the open 2-cell is the bounded complementary region of that curve."

`Schoenflies.inside` is the union of the *bounded* complementary components of a set, so
"the bounded complementary region of the Jordan curve `J`" is literally `inside J`; and by
`Schoenflies.jordan_curve_theorem` it is a single region. -/

/-- **Assertion (vii)** of `lem:cellulation-invariants**, for one realization: every open 2-cell
is the bounded complementary region of a Jordan curve, namely its own frontier.

Stated against `frontier (R.cell F)` rather than against the boundary walk; see the module
docstring. Under assertion (i) the frontier *is* the union of the open cells strictly below `F`
(`IsCellDecomposition.faceBoundary_eq_frontier`), which is the blueprint's boundary walk read
as a set. -/

"An edge subdivision changes no 2-cell." Literally: the 2-cells of `S.subdivideEdge d` are those

`CellStructure.subdivideEdge` now takes the replacement boundary lists from `SubdivData`.
`SubstWalk` is a relation rather than a function because the direction of a crossing is
determined by the walk and not by the edge list.  The data carries one corrected list for each
face together with the fact that it replaces a closed old boundary walk. -/

/-! #### The refinement relation of one split -/

/-- **`R'` refines `R` along the split `d`.** The fields are the blueprint's own sentences: the
old open 2-cell is the disjoint union of the two new open 2-cells and the *open* cells of the
ear; the closure of each new 2-cell is itself together with the ear and its own boundary path;
and the ear's own cells are incident as a path.

Exactly as with `SubdivData.IsRefinement`, this is local data — it speaks only of the cells the
split creates and of the split 2-cell — and `IsRefinement.isCellDecomposition` upgrades it to
assertion (i) for the whole refined structure. `IsCrosscutSplit.isRefinement` constructs it from
`thm:general-crosscut`. -/

/-! #### The geometric input of one split, and the two invariants constructed from it

`thm:general-crosscut` is applied here, and only here. Its two standing hypotheses on `main` —
`thm:jordan` and `HasArcCollars` — are both discharged: the first by
`Schoenflies.jordan_curve_theorem`, the second by `Schoenflies.IsCrosscut.hasArcCollars`, which
is why `IsCrosscutSplit` need not mention either. -/

/-- **The geometric input of one 2-cell split**: the realized ear is a polygonal crosscut of the
Jordan region realizing the split 2-cell, the two abstract boundary paths realize the two arcs
that crosscut cuts the boundary curve into, and the two new open 2-cells are the two sides.

Everything the split needs downstream — assertion (i) at the new stage
(`IsCrosscutSplit.isRefinement`) and assertion (vii) at the new stage
(`IsCrosscutSplit.isFaceJordan`) — is *constructed* from this by
`Schoenflies.crosscut_theorem`, not assumed.

The four clauses about the ear's own cells are the only thing left assumed: the crosscut theorem
treats the ear as a single arc `P` and says nothing about how the ear's vertices and edges
subdivide it. They are statements about the drawing of a path graph and belong with whichever
module draws the ear. -/

/-- **Both invariants at once**: one 2-cell split of a realization satisfying (i) and (vii)
produces a realization satisfying (i) and (vii), and the pair is a `Realization.Refines`. This
is the whole induction step of `lem:cellulation-invariants` over the second constructor. -/
