# Face cycles: the proof

`lem:face-cycles` — *every face of a finite 2-connected polygonal plane graph has a cycle as its
boundary and is one of the two complementary regions of that cycle*. `Schoenflies/FaceCycles.lean`
built the base cycle, its 2-connectivity, and the topology of adding an ear; this module runs
the induction of the blueprint's proof on top of them.

## READ THIS FIRST: what is assumed

`Graph.face_cycles` **carries a hypothesis, `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`, which nothing
proves.** It is the exhaustion clause of `thm:polygonal-crosscut` — "the crosscut replaces `F`
by exactly two regions" — stated for a crosscut whose two endpoints are *arbitrary points of
the curve*. Everything else in the blueprint's proof is discharged here without hypotheses, and
each of those pieces is a standalone theorem below.

`main`'s Theorem 2.8 does **not** discharge it, and the obstruction is not a missing bridge.
`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut` states its two splitting hypotheses against
`ClosedPolygon.arcPieces C a k`, which cuts the polygon's edge list at two of *its vertices*;
and `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` says every vertex of every realization of a
curve is a corner of it. In the induction below the two cut points are the ear's endpoints —
graph vertices at which the two cycle edges may leave along opposite rays, so that the boundary
curve runs *straight* through the cut point. Such a point is a vertex of no `ClosedPolygon`
with that carrier, and `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon_split` (whose `IsCornerAt` hypotheses
are therefore not an artefact) cannot be applied.

There is a **second, independent** reason, and it bites even when both cut points *are*
corners. `IsPolygonalCrosscut.edges₁` asks for `SameEdges J₁.pieces (C.arcPieces a k ++ K)`,
a multiset equality of unoriented segments. The list on the right has two pieces ending at the
cut point `q` — the arc's last and the crosscut's first. If those two are collinear, the curve
`J₁ = A₁ ∪ P` runs straight through `q`, so `q` is a vertex of no `ClosedPolygon` with that
carrier and *no* piece of `J₁.pieces` ends there: the multiset equality is unsatisfiable. Since
the crosscut may perfectly well leave a cut vertex along the ray opposite the arriving arc edge,
`edges₁` and `edges₂` are not dischargeable as stated. Deleting the redundant vertex —
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.deleteLast` — repairs the *realization* and breaks `SameEdges` in the
same move.

Closing the gap therefore means restating Theorem 2.8 with the edge lists related by *parity*
rather than by `SameEdges`, for a split made at arbitrary points of the curve. The tools exist:
`Schoenflies.parity_split` is already stated for arbitrary lists, and
`Schoenflies.parity_subdivide` (Lemma 2.1) absorbs the difference between a merged piece and its
two halves. What is missing is the parity theory of presentations carrying redundant vertices —
`Schoenflies.parity_eq_one_iff` for `Schoenflies.PrePolygon` rather than only for
`ClosedPolygon`, obtained by carrying the parity along the normalization induction of
`Schoenflies.PrePolygon.exists_closedPolygon_of_prePolygon`. That is a separate module.

## Main results

* **The realisation of a cycle is a separating curve** (`Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isSeparating`),
  which is what the base case needed and what `main` could not say. It composes
  `Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isJordanCurve` with `Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon` and
  `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isSeparating_carrier`. The polygonality half needed a bridge that
  `main` did not have: `Schoenflies.IsPolygonal` is the carrier of *one* vertex list, so a union
  of edge arcs is polygonal only once each arc is known to be a polyline running from one of its
  ends to the other (`Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.exists_poly_eq`, which rests on the arc
  uniqueness `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.eq_of_subset`).
* **The base case** (`Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_cycleGraph`): the cycle subgraph occupies
  exactly the cycle's realisation, so its faces are the two regions of that curve.
* **Cutting a cycle at two of its vertices** (`Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at`) and **splicing an
  ear onto an arc** (`Graph.exists_spliced_cycle`) — the combinatorics of "both bounded by
  cycles" — together with the geometric reading of the split
  (`Graph.IsDrawing.arcs_of_split`).
* **The step's topology**: the enlarged exterior is the old one minus the ear
  (`Graph.IsDrawing.pointSet_pathGraphOf`), a face the ear misses survives with its cycle
  (`Graph.IsFaceCycle.mono`), and the face the ear cuts is cut only inside itself
  (`Schoenflies.connectedComponentIn_diff`).

## For the integrator

`Graph.IsPath.append`, `Graph.IsPath.split_meet`, `Graph.IsWalk.walkVertices_eq_covered`,
`Graph.IsWalk.walkVertices_reverse_eq`, `Graph.coveredVertices_congr_of_le`,
`Graph.walkVertices_congr_of_le` and `Graph.edgesCover_append` / `…_perm` / `…_reverse` are
general and belong in `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean` and `Schoenflies/Graph/CycleJordan.lean`.
`Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.eq_of_subset` belongs in `Schoenflies/Subarc.lean` and
`Schoenflies.poly_append_join` in `Schoenflies/PolyPath.lean`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.eq_of_subset`, `Schoenflies.IsArcBetween.exists_poly_eq`,
  `Graph.IsDrawing.exists_poly_eq_edgesCover`, `Graph.IsDrawing.isPolygonal_edgesCover` — §1,
  the polygonality of what a walk draws.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isSeparating` — `thm:polygonal-jordan` for the realisation of a cycle:
  "This is true for the initial cycle by Theorem `thm:polygonal-jordan`."
* `Graph.IsFaceCycle`, `Graph.HasFaceCycles` — the conclusion of `lem:face-cycles`, at one face
  and at all of them.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_cycleGraph` — the base case.
* `Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at`, `Graph.IsDrawing.arcs_of_split`,
  `Graph.exists_spliced_cycle` — "Theorem `thm:polygonal-crosscut` replaces `F` by exactly two
  regions, both bounded by cycles", combinatorially.
* `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion` — **the assumed** exhaustion clause of
  `thm:polygonal-crosscut` at arbitrary cut points.
* `Graph.IsDrawing.hasFaceCycles_union` — one ear.
* `Graph.face_cycles` — `lem:face-cycles`, modulo `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`.

/-! ## The obligation this module does not discharge

**Read this before using `Graph.face_cycles`.** Everything below the base case is proved
*modulo* one hypothesis, `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`, and the final theorem carries it
as an argument. It is the exhaustion clause of `thm:polygonal-crosscut` — Theorem 2.8, in the
shape `Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut.region_eq` and
`Schoenflies.IsPolygonalCrosscut.cell_isComponent₁` already have it — at a crosscut whose two
endpoints are **arbitrary points of the curve**.

`main`'s Theorem 2.8 cannot be applied here, and the reason is not a missing bridge. Its
hypotheses `edges₁`/`edges₂` are stated against `ClosedPolygon.arcPieces C a k`, which splits
the polygon's edge list **at two of its vertices**; and by
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isCornerAt_vertex` every vertex of every realization of a curve is a
*corner* of it. In the induction below the two cut points are the ear's endpoints, which are
graph vertices at which the two cycle edges may perfectly well leave along opposite rays — the
curve then runs straight through the cut point, which is therefore a vertex of no
`ClosedPolygon` with that carrier, and no realization theorem can supply one. Discharging this
hypothesis needs Theorem 2.8 restated for an edge-list split made at arbitrary points, which in
turn needs the parity theory for polygon presentations carrying redundant vertices
(`Schoenflies.PrePolygon`) rather than only for `ClosedPolygon`. That is a separate module. -/

/-- **The exhaustion clause of the polygonal crosscut theorem, at arbitrary cut points.**
`J` is a separating polygonal curve cut by the points `p, q` into the arcs `A₁, A₂`; `P` is a
polygonal crosscut from `p` to `q` meeting `J` only there and running inside the region `Ω`.
The claim is that every component of `Ω ∖ P` is a region of `A₁ ∪ P` or of `A₂ ∪ P` — the
blueprint's "Theorem 2.8 replaces `F` by exactly two regions, both bounded by cycles".

This is **assumed**, not proved; see the section docstring for why `main`'s Theorem 2.8 does
not apply. -/

/-! ## The induction step: one ear

"Suppose it holds for the current graph and add the next geometric ear. Its interior is
connected and disjoint from the current graph, so it lies in one current face `F` … the ear is
therefore a crosscut of that side, and Theorem `thm:polygonal-crosscut` replaces `F` by exactly
two regions, both bounded by cycles; all other faces are unchanged."

Everything here is proved, except that the appeal to Theorem 2.8 is to the hypothesis
`Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion` instead. -/

/-- **One ear.** Given `lem:face-cycles` for the current subgraph, it holds for the subgraph
enlarged by an ear — modulo `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`. -/

/-! ## `lem:face-cycles`

"The cycle `C` is 2-connected, so Lemma `lem:relative-ear` builds the graph from `C`. We prove
by induction that every face is exactly one of the two regions bounded by its boundary cycle." -/

/-- **`lem:face-cycles` (face cycles).** Every face of a finite 2-connected polygonal plane
graph has a cycle as its boundary and is one of the two complementary regions of that cycle.

**The statement carries the hypothesis `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`**, which is *not*
proved anywhere: it is the exhaustion clause of `thm:polygonal-crosscut` at a crosscut whose
endpoints need not be corners of the curve, and `main`'s Theorem 2.8 cannot supply it — see the
docstring of `Schoenflies.CrosscutSplitsRegion`. Everything else in the blueprint's proof is
discharged here: the base cycle and its 2-connectivity (`Schoenflies/FaceCycles.lean`), that
its realisation separates the plane (`Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isSeparating`), that the ear lies in
one face and is a crosscut of it, that all other faces are unchanged, and that the two new
faces are bounded by the two cycles the ear splices onto the two arcs of the old one. -/
