# Finite transfer, direction (a): toward the square

`thm:finite-transfer` is the largest single statement of the manuscript. This module states it —
in full, with every hypothesis — for **direction (a)** only, and proves as much of its four-step
proof as is within reach of what is on `main`.

Direction (b) is deliberately absent: its extra accessibility problem at the wild source
boundary needs `lem:tangent-cone`, `lem:compact-separation`(c) and the fresh-point bookkeeping
of the target mesh, none of which enters (a).

## The statement, and how it is read

The blueprint's (a) reads: *let `(Γ, Γ')` be a generated matched cellulation; suppose `H` is a
finite 2-connected plane graph containing a subdivision of `Γ`, with outer cycle `C`, with every
nonboundary edge polygonal, and with `|H| ∖ C` connected; then the common subdivision can be
made on `Γ'`, and `H` can be transferred to an admissible target realization `H'`; the resulting
generated matched cellulation refines the old one by explicit parent maps.*

Four objects carry that sentence.

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsWeaklyAdmissible` and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsAdmissible` — `def:admissible-graph`. The weak form
  is exactly the strong one with connectedness of the open nonboundary part waived, which is
  what `def:generated-structure` requires of an intermediate stage and what
  `rem:intermediate-disconnection` insists on.
* `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair` — a generated matched cell structure *with its geometry*: the
  abstract structure, its two realizations, the skeleton homeomorphism, and the two cell
  decompositions. This is the Lean form of "`(Γ, Γ')` is a generated matched cellulation".
  It is a bundle of **data**, not an existential: every consumer reads `.src`, `.tgt`, `.homeo`
  by name.
* `Schoenflies.IsSourceExtension` — the hypotheses on `H`.
* `Schoenflies.IsTransferOf` — the conclusion, relating the new pair to the old one by an
  explicit parent map.

The one place where the Lean statement is *weaker in form* than the prose, and deliberately so:
"`H` can be transferred" is recorded as `T.src.skeletonSet = pointSet H Hdraw`, an equality of
point sets, rather than as a graph isomorphism onto `H`. The reason is step 1: the common
subdivision inserts a vertex at every intersection of a new edge with an old one, so the source
realization of the transferred structure realizes a *subdivision* of `H`, never `H` itself. What
survives verbatim is what the construction uses downstream — the occupied set, the
2-connectivity (which `lem:combinatorial-invariance` moves to the target) and the refinement.

## What is proved here

* **Step 1, the overlay** — `Schoenflies.exists_overlay_of_biUnion_finite`: the union of
  finitely many nondegenerate polygonal sets is the point set of a finite plane graph drawn by
  straight segments. That is `lem:polygonal-overlay` in the form step 1 needs, bridging
  `Schoenflies.polygonal_overlay`, which is stated for a list of segments, to the finite family
  of polygonal *arcs* a skeleton stage arrives as.
* **Step 4, target side** — `Schoenflies.exists_target_crosscut` and
  `Schoenflies.exists_target_crosscut_split`. In direction (a) the target face `F*` is a
  polygonal Jordan region in the square by `lem:cellulation-invariants`(vii); every point of its
  boundary is polygonally accessible from its interior by `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility`
  (target half); and `lem:accessible-endpoints` gives a polygonal crosscut `P* ⊆ closure F*`
  from `v*` to `w*`, which by `thm:general-crosscut` splits `F*` into exactly the two Jordan
  regions bounded by `P*` and the two boundary paths. These constructions supply the complete
  target-side argument.
* **The second sentence of step 2** — `…IsCellDecomposition.exists_unique_face_subset_cell` and
  `…IsCellDecomposition.exists_face_of_ear`: the interior of an ear lies in one current face,
  because it is connected and disjoint from the current skeleton, and its two endpoints then lie
  on that face's boundary cycle. `IsCellDecomposition.cellsAbsorb` derives the formerly named
  `CellsAbsorb` premise from the maintained cell-decomposition and Jordan-face invariants, so
  this requires no additional interface.
* **One ear insertion, step 3** — `exists_sourceEarStepData`,
  `EarCrosscut.exists_matched_target`, `earStepConstruction`, and `earStep`. The ambient source
  path is given fresh abstract cell names, its face split is realized on both sides, and a
  parameter-matching homeomorphism divides the target polygonal crosscut into exactly the same
  abstract edges. Matching source and target crosscuts then produce the next pair, compose both
  refinement maps, preserve every bundle invariant, and enlarge the occupied source graph by
  exactly the supplied ear, under the necessary `[Infinite γ]` name supply.
* **The last paragraph of the proof** — `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair.src_isAdmissible` and
  `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair.tgt_isAdmissible`. Admissibility of the *final* object is
  recovered from `lem:combinatorial-invariance`: the reproduced realization has the same
  2-connectivity and the same connectedness of the open nonboundary part as the given one.
  This uses only the hypotheses of the finite-transfer statement.
* **The induction scheme, steps 2 and 3** — `Schoenflies.transfer_of_ears`. With `earStep`
  supplying each insertion, `lem:relative-ear` in its iterated form
  (`Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition`) transfers the whole extension. This is the backbone
  of the induction, and it honours `rem:intermediate-disconnection`: the invariant carried
  through the induction, `Schoenflies.IsPartialTransferOf`, asks only for *weak* admissibility,
  and connectedness of the open nonboundary part is restored only at the very end.

## Completion of step 1

This module keeps `Schoenflies.CommonSubdivision` as the compositional interface consumed by the
ear induction.  `Schoenflies/CommonSubdivision.lean` constructs it: it traces the part of `H`
supported on the old skeleton, proves that trace 2-connected, and carries all of its finitely many
vertices through matched source/target edge subdivisions.  Consequently direction (a) is exposed
there as `Schoenflies.finite_transfer_toward_square`.

## Blueprint

* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsWeaklyAdmissible`,
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsAdmissible` — `def:admissible-graph`.
* `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair` — `def:generated-structure` with its two realizations,
  `def:matched-pair` and `def:matched-cellulation` folded in.
* `Schoenflies.IsSourceExtension` — the hypotheses of `thm:finite-transfer`(a) on `H`.
* `Schoenflies.IsPartialTransferOf`, `Schoenflies.IsTransferOf` — the conclusion of
  `thm:finite-transfer`, at an intermediate stage and at the end.
* `Schoenflies.exists_target_crosscut`, `Schoenflies.exists_target_crosscut_split` —
  the fourth paragraph of the proof of `thm:finite-transfer`, direction (a):
  `lem:cellulation-invariants`(vii) + `lem:polygonal-side-accessibility` +
  `lem:accessible-endpoints` + `thm:general-crosscut`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.IsCellDecomposition.exists_unique_face_subset_cell`,
  `…IsCellDecomposition.exists_face_of_ear`,
  `…IsCellDecomposition.sub_of_pos_mem_closure_cell` — "the interior of each ear lies in one
  current face", with the two supporting facts
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.cell_subset_skeletonSet` (hoisted to
  `Schoenflies/CombinatorialInvariance.lean`) and
  `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.mem_faces_of_notMem_skeletonSet`.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.Realization.pos_mem_closure_cell_congr`,
  `Schoenflies.exists_target_ear` — "let `F*, v*, w*` be the corresponding face and endpoints in
  the other realization", and the whole fourth paragraph assembled from the source-side data.
* `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair.src_isAdmissible`, `Schoenflies.GeneratedPair.tgt_isAdmissible` —
  the last paragraph of the proof, via `lem:combinatorial-invariance`.
* `Schoenflies.exists_overlay_of_biUnion_finite` — `lem:polygonal-overlay` and
  `rem:polygonal-overlay-convention`, for a finite family of polygonal sets: the first half of
  step 1.
* `Schoenflies.earStep` — step 3; `Schoenflies.CommonSubdivision` — the step-1 interface,
  discharged by `Schoenflies.commonSubdivision` in `CommonSubdivision.lean`.
* `Schoenflies.transfer_of_ears_of_commonSubdivision_of_earStep`,
  `Schoenflies.finite_transfer_toward_square_of_commonSubdivision_of_earStep` — the
  finite-transfer induction parametrized by its two construction interfaces.

An admissible graph in the closed Jordan domain is a finite 2-connected plane graph whose outer
cycle is `C`, whose edges not contained in `C` are polygonal arcs with interiors in `D`, and
whose open nonboundary part `|Γ| ∖ C` is connected. A *weakly* admissible graph satisfies
everything but the last clause.

`outer` is the realized outer cycle and `dom` the closed domain; the open domain is `dom ∖
outer`. On the source side that reads `C` and `C ∪ D`; on the target side `S` and `Q`. -/

/-! ### A generated matched cell structure, with its geometry

`def:generated-structure` says what the *abstract* object is; `GeneratedStructure` in
`Schoenflies/GeneratedStructure.lean` is that. What a transfer produces, and what the
finite-transfer theorem consumes, is the abstract object together with its two realizations, the
skeleton homeomorphism between them, and the two cell decompositions of
`lem:cellulation-invariants`(i). That bundle is `GeneratedPair`.

It is data, not a `Prop`: a consumer reads `.src`, `.tgt`, `.homeo`, `.str` by name. -/

"`(Γ, Γ')` is a generated matched cellulation", except that only *weak* admissibility is a

/-! ### The hypotheses of direction (a) on the given extension

*`H` is a finite 2-connected plane graph containing a subdivision of `Γ`, with outer cycle `C`,
with every nonboundary edge polygonal, and with `|H| ∖ C` connected.*

"Contains a subdivision of `Γ`" is recorded by three clauses: every old vertex is a vertex of
`H`; the old skeleton is inside `|H|`; and any edge of `H` whose nonvertex part meets an *open*
old edge lies inside that old edge. Together those say that each old edge is cut into a chain of
`H`-edges. A transverse crossing is allowed only at a vertex of `H`, exactly as produced by the
polygonal overlay.

"With outer cycle `C`, with every nonboundary edge polygonal" is `edge_dichotomy`: each edge of
`H` either lies inside the outer curve or is polygonal with its interior in the open domain.
Recording the outer cycle as a *subgraph* would put data inside a `Prop`; this reading is what
every step of the proof actually uses, and `outer ⊆ pointSet H Hdraw` comes for free from
`skeletonSet_subset`. -/

/-! ### The conclusion

`IsPartialTransferOf T P B par` is the invariant the induction of steps 2–3 carries: `T` is a
generated pair refining `P` along `par` whose source realization occupies exactly what the
current subgraph `B` of `H` occupies. It asks for **no** connectedness of the open nonboundary
part — `rem:intermediate-disconnection` — because an ear with both endpoints on the outer cycle
really does disconnect it, and later ears reconnect it.

`IsTransferOf` is the same with admissibility of both final realizations added; that is the
theorem's conclusion, and `GeneratedPair.src_isAdmissible` / `GeneratedPair.tgt_isAdmissible`
are what produce it from the connectedness hypothesis on `H`. -/

/-! ### The two assumed steps

Both are strictly weaker than `thm:finite-transfer`(a) itself, and both are statements a later
module can discharge without circularity.

`CommonSubdivision` is **step 1**: after overlaying the proposed polygonal nonboundary edges
with the old polygonal nonboundary skeleton and subdividing at every intersection — and
transferring each new point to the other realization along the chosen edge parametrization —
the old skeleton is literally a subgraph of the new one on both sides. In Lean that is: some
2-connected subgraph `K ≤ H` carries a generated pair refining the given one. It is not the
theorem: it makes only edge subdivisions, inserts no ear, and its conclusion is about a subgraph
of `H`, not about `H`.

`EarStep` is **step 3**: one ear insertion — at most two edge subdivisions followed by one
2-cell split — carries a partial transfer of `B` to a partial transfer of `B` with the ear glued
on. Its geometric core in direction (a) is `Schoenflies.exists_target_crosscut_split` below,
which is proved here; only the abstract-data bookkeeping around it is assumed.

**`EarStep` carries `[Infinite γ]`, and without it the hypothesis is false.** Every cell of
every structure in sight is a *name* drawn from the one type `γ`: `V(skel)`, `E(skel)` and
`faces` are three disjoint subsets of it. An ear insertion consumes fresh names — one per
interior vertex of the ear, one per ear edge, and two for the 2-cells the split creates
(`SplitData.edge_fresh`, `.vertex_fresh`, `.face₁_notMem`, `.face₂_notMem`) — while the
conclusion `IsPartialTransferOf T' P (B ∪ ear) Hdraw par'` forces `T'` to realize a subdivision
of the enlarged graph, so `V(B ∪ ear) ⊆ V(T'.src.graph) = T'.src.pos '' V(T'.str.skel)` and the
new skeleton must occupy strictly more of the plane than the old one. On a finite `γ` those
demands eventually exceed the supply: a structure realizing a subdivision of a 2-connected graph
with `e` edges needs at least `e` edge names, at least as many vertex names, and at least one
face name per complementary region, all pairwise distinct inside `γ`. A `γ` large enough to
carry the transfer of `B` and too small to carry the transfer of `B` with one more ear makes the
hypotheses of `EarStep` satisfiable and its conclusion unsatisfiable.

That argument is prose, not machine-checked: pinning it down needs a `GeneratedPair` over an
exactly-exhausted finite `γ`, which is a page of construction for a defect the type class
removes outright. What *is* machine-checked is that nothing below needs more than `Infinite γ`,
and the consumer instantiates `γ := ℕ`. The rule that found this is the standing one: a
hypothesis must be a statement one believes, and `EarStep` without a supply of fresh names is
not one. -/

    K.IsTwoConnected ∧ K ≤ H ∧ IsPartialTransferOf T₀ P K Hdraw par₀

/-- **Step 3, one ear insertion**, as an interface.

The data handed to the step is exactly what `Graph.IsTwoConnected.ear_decomposition` supplies:
the current subgraph `B`, the ear `D` as a path of `H` between two distinct vertices of `B`, and
the freshness of the ear's interior — which is what makes the ear's interior lie in a single
current face, since it is connected and disjoint from the current skeleton.

`Infinite γ` is not decoration: the step consumes fresh cell names, and on a finite `γ` the
statement is false. See the section docstring above. -/

ear insertion is at most two edge subdivisions plus one 2-cell split, so every intermediate stage
is a generated matched cell structure. Given step 1 and one ear, the whole extension transfers.

The invariant carried through the induction is `IsPartialTransferOf`, which does **not** mention
connectedness of the open nonboundary part: `rem:intermediate-disconnection` says an
intermediate stage may genuinely have it disconnected, and nothing here assumes otherwise. -/

Let `(Γ, Γ')` be a generated matched cellulation. Suppose `H` is a finite 2-connected plane graph
containing a subdivision of `Γ`, with outer cycle `C`, with every nonboundary edge polygonal, and
with `|H| ∖ C` connected. Then the common subdivision can be made on `Γ'`, and `H` can be
transferred to an admissible target realization `H'`; the resulting generated matched cellulation
refines the old one by an explicit parent map.

This compatibility form accepts both step interfaces as arguments. `earStep` discharges the
second, while `commonSubdivision` in `CommonSubdivision.lean` discharges the first. -/

/-! ### Step 4, direction (a): the target crosscut

*In part (a), `F*` is a polygonal Jordan region in the square, by
`lem:cellulation-invariants`(vii). Every point of its boundary is polygonally accessible from its
interior. `lem:accessible-endpoints` therefore gives a polygonal crosscut `P* ⊆ closure F*` from
`v*` to `w*`.* Then: *`thm:general-crosscut` says that the crosscut splits the face into exactly
the two Jordan regions bounded by the crosscut together with those two paths.*

That whole paragraph is proved below. It is stated for a *target* face — a
member of a family of components of `Q ∖ |G|` for an ambient open region `Q` whose frontier
belongs to the skeleton — because that is the shape
`Graph.polygonal_side_accessibility_target` consumes, and it is the shape a target realization
of a generated structure has: `Q` is the open square, `|G|` the target skeleton, and the family
is the set of realized open 2-cells. -/

complementary region of the Jordan curve `J` realizing its boundary walk; the crosscut of
`Schoenflies.exists_target_crosscut` is then a crosscut of `J` in the sense of
`thm:general-crosscut`, which decomposes `F` into the two Jordan regions bounded by the crosscut
together with the two boundary paths.

The conclusion is returned in the shape assertion (i) consumes at a 2-cell split
(`Schoenflies.crosscut_cell_partition`): the old open 2-cell is the disjoint union of the two new
open 2-cells and the open crosscut, each new 2-cell is open and nonempty, and the closure of each
is that open 2-cell together with its own boundary curve. -/

/-! ### Step 1: the overlay

*By `lem:polygonal-overlay`, using the convention of `rem:polygonal-overlay-convention`, first
overlay the proposed polygonal nonboundary edges with the old polygonal nonboundary skeleton and
subdivide at all intersections.*

`Schoenflies.polygonal_overlay` does that for a **list of segments**. What step 1 has instead is
a finite family of polygonal *arcs* — the old nonboundary edges and the proposed new ones — so
the two have to be bridged. `Schoenflies.exists_overlay_of_biUnion_finite` is that bridge, and it
is the half of step 1 that is proved here: the union of finitely many nondegenerate polygonal
sets is the point set of a finite plane graph drawn by straight segments, whose vertices are the
ends of the subdivided pieces and therefore include every intersection point.

The nondegeneracy hypothesis is necessary, not cosmetic: a one-point set is polygonal
(`poly [a] = {a}`) and is not the point set of any overlay graph, whose vertices are the ends of
nondegenerate segments.

The matching-subdivision half of step 1 is completed in `CommonSubdivision.lean`: every source
subdivision point is transported through the chosen edge parametrization to the other
realization. -/

/-- **`lem:polygonal-overlay` for a finite family of polygonal sets.** The union of finitely many

/-! ### The interface, exercised

`thm:finite-transfer` exists to feed the recursion of the quantitative-refinement section, which
consumes a transfer only through `Realization.Refines`. This anonymous example is a
machine-checked statement that the conclusion of `finite_transfer_toward_square` delivers exactly
what that recursion reads: the source carrier refines (`lem:refinement-compatibility`(a)), the
same parent map serves both sides (part (c)), and the closed target star of a fixed source point
shrinks (`T_{n+1}(x) \subseteq T_n(x)`).

Nothing below mentions how the transfer was built. If a later change to `IsTransferOf` stopped
serving that recursion, this would break. -/
