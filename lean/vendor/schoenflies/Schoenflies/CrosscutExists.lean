# Building the crosscut of the outer-chain descent

`Graph.CrosscutExists`, the combinatorial half of the descent step of `lem:outer-chain`,
discharged. Nothing here is geometric: the only fact about the plane that enters is
`Graph.IsPlaneChain.disjoint_block_far`, "`Γ j` meets the earlier chain only through
`Γ (j-1)`", and it is used exactly twice, to say that a vertex cannot lie on both
`Γ i ∪ ⋯ ∪ Γ (j-2)` and `Γ j`.

## The blueprint's argument, and how it is formalised here

The blueprint chooses points `a, b` in the relative interiors of an edge of `Γ j` and an edge
of the earlier chain, cuts the cycle `C` there, observes that each of the two arcs must meet
`Γ (j-1)`, and takes a minimum-length path of `Γ (j-1)` between two *maximal subpaths of
`C ∩ Γ (j-1)`* lying on different arcs.

Cutting a cycle at interior points of two of its edges is, combinatorially, the statement that
two distinct edges `g₁ ≠ g₂` of the cycle split the remaining edges into two arcs
(`Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at_edges`): the closed walk reads

  `… ─g₁→ p ─W₁→ q ─g₂→ q' ─W₂→ p' ─g₁→ …`

and the two arcs are `W₁` and `W₂`, whose visited sets `S₁`, `S₂` are **disjoint** and
**cover** the vertices of the cycle. That pair of facts replaces the notion of a maximal
subpath entirely:

* "`a` and `b` lie on different maximal subpaths of `C ∩ Γ (j-1)`" becomes `a ∈ S₁`, `b ∈ S₂`;
* the property of maximal subpaths that the argument actually consumes — that no subpath of
  `C ∩ Γ (j-1)` joins two of them — becomes `Graph.exists_isCycleCrosscut`'s hypothesis
  `hpres`: *every edge of the cycle that `Γ (j-1)` also has keeps both of its ends on the same
  side*. That is immediate here, because the only cycle edges joining the two sides are `g₁`
  and `g₂`, and neither is an edge of `Γ (j-1)`.

With that, walking along cycle edges of `Γ (j-1)` cannot cross from `S₁` to `S₂`, and all four
minimality clauses of `Graph.IsCycleCrosscut` fall out of one minimisation: among all walks of
`Γ (j-1)` from `S₁` to `S₂`, take one of least length.

* it is a path, because any walk between its own two ends is a competitor
  (`Graph.IsWalk.isPath_of_minLength`);
* its internal vertices miss `C`, because a vertex of `C` on it lies in `S₁` or in `S₂`, and
  either way one of the two halves is a strictly shorter competitor;
* no edge of it is an edge of `C`: such an edge has both ends on `C`, hence both ends among
  `{a, b}` by the previous clause, hence joins `S₁` to `S₂` while lying in `Γ (j-1)`, which
  `hpres` forbids;
* each arc of `C` between `a` and `b` carries an edge outside `Γ (j-1)`, since otherwise the
  arc itself would be a walk of cycle edges of `Γ (j-1)` from `S₁` to `S₂`.

## Two general lemmas

`Graph.IsPath.split_at_edge` (cut a path at one of its edges, with the two freshness clauses
`Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_aux` asks for) and `Graph.IsCycleThrough.rotate` (present a cycle
through any one of its edges) are general facts about walks with nothing to do with this
development; they are the missing companions of `Graph.IsPath.split_meet` and
`Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at` and belong in `Schoenflies/Graph/Walk.lean` and
`Schoenflies/FaceCyclesProof.lean` respectively.

## Blueprint

* `Graph.IsPath.split_at_edge`, `Graph.IsCycleThrough.rotate`,
  `Graph.IsCycleThrough.split_at_edges` — "choose points `a, b` in the relative interiors of
  these two edges. The two arcs of the cycle `C` from `a` to `b` are internally disjoint",
  read combinatorially (`lem:outer-chain`).
* `Graph.exists_isCycleCrosscut` — "since `Γ_{j-1}` is connected, there is a path in `Γ_{j-1}`
  from `P` to `C ∖ V(P)`. Choose such a path `R` of minimum length …", the whole minimality
  paragraph of `lem:outer-chain`, with the chain abstracted away into the two sides `S₁, S₂`.
* `Graph.IsPlaneChain.crosscutExists` — **`Graph.CrosscutExists`**, the combinatorial half of
  the descent step of `lem:outer-chain`.

/-! ## The crosscut, from a two-sided cycle and a connected subgraph -/

/-- **The minimality paragraph of `lem:outer-chain`, with the chain abstracted away.**

The cycle `e :: D` of `H` has its vertices split into two disjoint sides `S₁, S₂` — in the
application, the two arcs cut off by an edge of `Γ j` and an edge of the earlier chain — in
such a way that no edge of the cycle lying in `F` joins the two sides (`hpres`). If `F` is
connected and has a vertex on each side, then a minimum-length path of `F` from one side to
the other is a crosscut of the cycle in the sense of `Graph.IsCycleCrosscut`.

`hpres` is what the blueprint's *maximal subpaths of `C ∩ Γ (j-1)`* are for: it is the only
property of them the argument uses, and here it is a one-line consequence of the two cut edges
being outside `F`. -/
