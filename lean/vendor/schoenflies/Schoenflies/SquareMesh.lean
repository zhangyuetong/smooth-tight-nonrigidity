# The anchored square mesh

The geometric core of Proposition `prop:anchored-square-mesh`, in vocabulary that exists today:
Part II's cellulations, `V_boundary` and fresh points `u(𝒜)` are not built here, so the mesh is
stated as a **finite plane graph with a straight-line drawing**, with the clauses of the
proposition as separate theorems about it.

## The construction

`squareMesh δ fresh anchors` is `meshCount δ` concentric ring frames of radii
`1/N, 2/N, …, 1` inside `Q = [-1,1]²`, together with one full-length radial spoke
`[z, N⁻¹ • z]` at each fresh boundary point `z`. The list of segments is handed to
`overlayGraph` (Lemma 3.7), which subdivides at every crossing; the anchors are added to the
cut points, which is what makes each of them a vertex.

**This is not literally the blueprint's construction, and the difference is deliberate.** The
blueprint has one collar `λ ≤ ‖x‖∞ ≤ 1` plus a rectangular grid filling `λQ`. Here the collar
is repeated `N` times and there is no grid at all: the innermost square `N⁻¹ Q` is a *single*
cell, of diameter `2√2/N < δ`. That removes the "choose fine enough horizontal and vertical
coordinates, including the four corners and all the points `λ z_i`" step entirely, and makes
the whole mesh radial, so that one estimate — `‖tz - sw‖ ≤ t‖z - w‖ + |t - s|‖w‖`, the
blueprint's own — covers every cell. Nothing downstream can tell the difference: the clauses
are the interface.

The blueprint's cyclic ordering of the fresh points is likewise gone. Where it says "choose
`z_0, …, z_{m-1}` in cyclic order so that each boundary arc between consecutive ones has
diameter `< δ/4`", this module takes the order-free consequence as a hypothesis,
`FreshDense fresh δ`: *every connected subset of `S` avoiding all the fresh points has diameter
at most `δ/2`*. A set-level statement needs no ordering, and it is exactly what the blueprint's
own argument (parametrize `S` by a circle, cut it into small arcs, put one fresh point inside
each) produces.

## What is proved, and what is not

The clauses about faces, anchors, edges reaching `S` and connectedness of `|T| ∖ S` are proved
in full. Two gaps, both stated plainly:

* **The outer cycle is proved only as a point set.** `squareMesh_cover_outerEdges` says the
  edges whose segments lie on `S` occupy exactly `S`. That these edges form a **cycle** of the
  graph is *not* proved: it needs the fresh points, the anchors and the four corners put in
  cyclic order along `S`, which is precisely the ordering this construction was designed to
  avoid. A later module wanting the outer cycle must build it.
* **2-connectivity is not proved at all.** It is not present as a hypothesis either — a
  hypothesis restating the goal would be worthless. The route is the blueprint's: the innermost
  ring is a cycle, and each annulus between consecutive rings is added one rectangle at a time
  by `Graph.IsTwoConnected.union`, each added cycle sharing at least two vertices with what is
  already there. Nothing in this module obstructs it.

Connectedness of `|T| ∖ S` needs at least one fresh point (`hz₀ : z₀ ∈ fresh`): with no spokes
the rings are disjoint frames.

## Blueprint

* `ringSet`, `ringPieces`, `spokePiece`, `meshSegments` — the mesh as a list of segments.
* `meshGraph`, `squareMesh` — Proposition "Anchored square mesh", the construction itself.
* `FreshDense` — the order-free form of "consecutive fresh points bound an arc of diameter
  `< δ/4`".
* `squareMesh_face_small` — clause 1: every bounded 2-cell has diameter `< δ`, and lies in `Q`.
* `squareMesh_anchor_mem_vertexSet` — clause 2: every boundary vertex survives.
* `squareMesh_inner_edge_at_fresh`, `squareMesh_unique_inner_edge` — clauses 3 and 4: a new
  internal edge meeting `S` ends at a fresh point, and exactly one such edge is incident with
  each fresh point.
* `squareMesh_cover_outerEdges` — the point-set half of "`S` is the outer cycle" (see above).
* `squareMesh_isConnected_diff` — clause 6: `|T| ∖ S` is connected.
* `radial_diam_bound` — the blueprint's radial estimate, isolated from all graph language.
* `subdivide_covers_source`, `subdivide_end_of_mem` — two general facts about `subdivide` that
  belong in `Schoenflies/Subdivide.lean`.

/-! ### Two more facts about `subdivide`

Both are general and belong beside the others in `Schoenflies/Subdivide.lean`; they are here
because that module is on `main`.

`subdivide_covers_source` refines `subdivide_cover`: a point of a *named* source piece lies on
a piece of the subdivision *inside that source*. Without the "inside that source" clause one
cannot tell, of a point where two sources cross, which of them the piece through it came from
— and the whole description of the mesh's edges is by their source.

`subdivide_end_of_mem` is the converse of `subdivide_avoids`: a cut point that lies on a source
piece is not merely absent from every interior, it is an **endpoint** of a piece inside that
source. That is what makes a prescribed point a vertex of the overlay graph. -/

is large. That is the one deviation from the blueprint's construction, and it removes the whole

/-! ### Clause 1: every bounded face is small

The estimate is the blueprint's, in radial coordinates. A connected set missing the mesh
misses every ring, so its sup norm — continuous, hence with a preconnected image in `ℝ` —
stays inside one open interval `(k/N, (k+1)/N)` between consecutive ring radii. Inside the
innermost square that is already the whole bound; outside it the radial projection
`x ↦ ‖x‖∞⁻¹ • x` maps the set into `S`, connectedly, and away from every fresh point, because
a point projecting to a fresh point lies on that point's spoke. The blueprint's

  `‖x - y‖ ≤ ‖tz - tw‖ + ‖tw - sw‖ < δ/4 + δ/4 + δ/4`

is then `t‖z - w‖ + |t - s|‖w‖`, with `‖z - w‖` controlled by `FreshDense` and `|t - s|` by
one ring thickness. -/

continuity to cut it into arcs of diameter `< δ/8`, and pick one fresh point in the relative
interior of each". Stated as a property of a *set* rather than of a cyclic order, it needs no
ordering of the fresh points along `S` — which is what makes the whole mesh order-free. -/
